Volvo Cars' sales of fully electric vehicles jump in October,"From the article:  ""*STOCKHOLM, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Volvo Cars' sales in October grew 10% from a year earlier to 59,861 cars as fully electric car sales jumped but hybrid models fell, the Sweden-based group said on Friday. Volvo Cars said in a statement sales of fully electric cars rose 29% to account for 18% of all its cars sold in the month. Sales of hybrid cars, however, fell 8%. In total, all recharge models were up 7% to account for 36% of total sales.*""  Note: this was originally posted in /r/EuroEV",2023-11-03 11:49:45,261,102,electricvehicles

electric vehicles to be stored in parking garage,"I moved into a condo building last month. It's primarily owners that are 65+. I have an electric standup scooter that's of very high value. I always bring it with me everywhere I go, and if a store says I can't bring it in I leave and don't give them my business.  I have been entering and exiting my apartment by the underground garage door. One of the residents in the hallways complained to the superintendent, saying I'm not allowed to bring it inside my unit.  The superintendent accosted me at my units door, and said until you get an accommodation from the board, you MUST store your *electric vehicles* in the bicycle lockup.  I have both a standing scooter and a motorcycle style ebike. The latter is an exact copy of, and the same size as, a Kawasaki Ninja 300. Not too big, but not tiny either.

Ford to delay all-electric SUV to focus on offering hybrid vehicles,"Ford Motor is delaying production of a new all-electric three row SUV, as it shifts to offer hybrid options across its entire North American lineup by 2030.  The Detroit automaker on Thursday said it will continue to invest in EVs, but it is postponing production of the large SUV at a plant in Canada from 2025 to 2027 to allow for the market to mature more.  The shift in EV plans is the latest for Ford and the entire automotive industry as adoption has been slower than many expected and production costs remain high.  Ford last year said it would delay or cancel $12 billion in planned spending on new EVs due to the shifting market conditions as well as challenges to profitably building and selling the vehicles.  ‚ÄúAs the No. 2 EV brand in the U.S. for the past two years, we are committed to scaling a profitable EV business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time,‚Äù said Jim Farley, Ford president and CEO. ‚ÄúOur breakthrough, next-generation EVs will be new from the ground up and fully software enabled, with ever-improving digital experiences and a multitude of potential services.‚Äù  In the first quarter of 2024, Ford‚Äôs electric vehicle sales increased by 86% from subdued levels a year earlier. Hybrid sales for the automaker rose 42% year over year, while sales of Ford‚Äôs traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines were up 2.6%.

What IS it with boomers and electric vehicles?   ,"I‚Äôve had an electric vehicle (EV) for several years.   It‚Äôs been my daily driver and designated road tripper.    Every now and then there will be an older fella at the car wash, grocery store or coffee stop that just can‚Äôt resist ‚Äòeducating‚Äô me on why my EV is stupid.  I used to say, look dude, if you don‚Äôt want an EV don‚Äôt buy one.   That usually got a litany of conspiracy rants.   Something like ‚ÄúChina is ramming EVs down our throats.‚Äù  Now I just smile and say have a nice day.  Edit after seeing 33 comments:  I wanted a few of the people to whom I replied 'have a nice day' to maybe take the hint and move their desire to educate over to r/electricvehicles or even r/RenewableEnergy or r/Renewable.   But then I realized that perhaps they've been tossed from those subs for posting unfactual and easily debunked misinformation.  So, I'll weigh in here.   I bought the EV after much research into the energy sources and their efficiency.   I was a cybersecurity consultant and amongst my clients were electric utilities so research was easy.  My research showed that even if the grid is 100% coal power an average EV pollutes 50% less in PM2.5 and 25% less CO2 than an equivalent gas car and that's when the gas car is brand new.   This includes the necessary maintenance on the gas car that isn't required on the EV and average 'delivery to plug' losses of the electric grid.   Where I live and where I drive for most road trips the grid is currently 40% coal-powered and that percentage goes down every year.  I also looked into the source and end-of-life issues of batteries.  Lithium batteries that are no longer effective for mobile applications are routinely repurposed for stationary uses, e.g. megapack for solar installations, and after the battery is completely used up, they're routinely recycled.   The rate at which they're reused and recycled is higher now than it was when I purchased my EV and continues to climb.  As with most EVs my battery does not use cobalt.  The above facts are discussed on those subs I referenced above, these things get asserted and debunked at least once a week on one or more of those subs.  At the time I purchased my EV the US federal tax incentive for EV purchases had expired and my state had never had them, and still doesn't.  When I register the car each year I pay an EV vehicle charge that is about what one would pay in state and federal gas taxes driving a similar sized sedan 20k mi per year.  So, I didn't get any subsidy to purchase the car, nor do I get a subsidy to drive it.  The main reason why I bought my EV was cost.   I have relatives that my SO and I help care for that are 800 mi away from my home so each trip to take a 'care shift' is > 1600 mi round trip.   My EV makes that trip cost approximately half what my similar-sized gas car cost to drive, when all the costs including maintenance, are considered.  The EV costs more than an equivalent gas car, yes, but I made up the cost difference at 60,000 miles (yes, I've kept track).   Commercial charging costs have dropped about 35% since I purchased the EV, which is something I cannot say about gas,  so it's even a better deal now with a shorter cost payback point.   Non-road trip use (daily driver) with off-peak charging at home the EV is insanely cheap, about $0.04/mile.  My EV is approaching 100,000 miles and battery analytics (shout out to Recurrent) show I still have greater than 90% capacity.  I anticipate the car will be worn out long before the battery degrades to the point where I'd notice it.  I live in an area that has winters with lots of snow and cold below-zero temps.   In several winters of EV driving and charging I've never had a problem.  This is something I cannot say about my gas cars (Honda and Toyota).  A fuel injection car with a frozen gas line is an all-day sucker.  Have a nice day!  Edit2:  1. **If you're going to come at me to justify every gram of material used in the battery I'm going to ignore you.**  All cars use materials of various origins.    Palladium is used in catalytic converters, magnesium is used in the manufacture of steel and cobalt is used as a catalyst in petroleum refining and used in air bags.  The price and supply of petroleum is largely controlled by the oligarchs in OPEC+, and some are awful human rights abusers.  Use these materials or walk, your choice. 2. Since many commenters have asked, my EV is a 2020 Tesla Model 3 Dual Motor LR.",2024-04-09 15:48:25,370,465,BoomersBeingFools

What Electric Vehicle are you excited about being released?,There was a lot of talk about the Cyber Truck.  It was polarizing and as such got a lot of discussion around it.  Personally I think it was a massive flop but that is just my opinion.  Then there was the Apple Car.  I think this had a ton of media and discussion because people associate Apple products with the future .  People had a lot of curiosity about exactly what was going to be released.  This project got cancelled.  There is also the Tesla Model 2.  A lot of people are excited about this because of the potential accessible price (Rumored 25k).

I've come to the conclusion that electric vehicles are toilet. ,"Today is the first time I've ever driven an electric vehicle.   It's a company van(Peugeot, ugh) and I needed to travel 65 miles, fully charged showed the range at 205. It's a brand new van, 300 miles on the clock so the battery isn't shagged.   Im sat at my destination with a 65 miles return journey to do.   This 65 mile journey so far has drained 105 miles of range, so basic maths tells me I'm 5 miles short to get home. I didn't drive like a bellend because they're all tracked to enforce compliance with speed limits, harsh acceleration etc. Had the regen braking on to give myself a bit of charge.   Had to use my own sat nav because the van doesn't have one and needed the heater on low because it's freezing. Wipers and lights on too due to heavy rain.   I'm sat at the destination freezing my tits off in silence for the next hour, unwilling to drain more range by using the heater or radio. Either way, I tried the radio and it powers down after 5 minutes even with the ignition on to save battery when you're not in gear or moving.   The van is also empty as well. I'd hate to see the range with another tonne of weight on board.   The location I'm at has no chargers and I can't leave site to go and charge it for an hour or two.   I've got no fuel card (which only works on about 10 percent of chargers anyway) and I don't fancy spending a few hours in the services charging up just to get me home.   What an absolute bag of bollocks. ",2024-03-20 11:14:16,457,651,CarTalkUK

Should I buy an electric car or a hybrid one?,"I am debating on whether I should buy a fully electric car or a hybrid car. At least for now, I am leaning towards a hybrid simply because I have family that lives 5 hours away (5 hours by car) and I like to visit them every 2 or 3 months. In my mind, a hybrid car would allow me to drive non-stop without having to worry about putting gas. I would rely on two types of energy. I absolutely hate taking stops when I drive unless, of course, I need to use the restroom.   Also, fully electric cars should be recharged every 300 miles approximately and it takes more than 30 minutes.   However, I am absolutely willing to change my mind if a fully electric car is better. This is new for me. I have just started looking into this and any advice would be appreciated.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;",2023-09-13 23:41:02,3,16,whatcarshouldIbuy

Your electric car runs on coal,"TL;DR at the end of the post.  Edit 2: u/FecalKing did a deeper read through than most and noted an important error. I used the energy conversation factor rather than the unit conversation factor for coal and gas while calculating gasoline equivalence. This over inflated the energy content of those fuel, which over inflated the milage. The mpg numbers have been updated but the emission numbers are unaffected by this change. **Updates are bold**  Edit 3: check out this link if you want some professional analysis, instead of the armchair engineering that follows. Thanks to u/sfo2 for the link. https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner  When people ask about my electric car, I often get the comment ‚ÄúWell, electric cars technically get their power from coal power plants, so actually my gas car/truck is better for the environment! Gotcha!‚Äù  Technically these people are not wrong about some electricity coming from coal, but they are also not well versed in advanced thermodynamics as is related to industrial scale power generation, as well as the variety of power generation methods used in the US. Note: All following info is for the US; international results may vary.  In my experience, people have a hard time conceptually with the massive efficiency increase between a small, variable RPM car motor, and a full size power plant. A lot of very smart people have spent a lot of time and made a lot of money by optimizing power plants into the modern engineering marvels we have (and take for granted) today.  To help deal with this annoying conversation, I ran some numbers. Let‚Äôs go on a journey of math and learning!  Extraction:  There are lots of emissions associated with getting gas/coal out of the ground and refined to a usable state. For ease of conversation here, let‚Äôs assume that the emissions associated with pulling stuff out of the ground, transporting it to a refinery, refining it, and transporting it to the gas station/power plant are the same and call it a wash.  Gas cars:  The EPA mandates that new cars and trucks (as of 2016) have a fleet average fuel efficiency of 35.5 mpg and emit no more than 250 grams CO2 per mile (https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100EZ7C.PDF?Dockey=P100EZ7C.PDF). This is the baseline we will be comparing against. Some cars will be higher or lower depending on age and specific application, but as we will see this doesn‚Äôt really matter to us.  Electric cars:  I have a 1st gen Nissan Leaf, and my average efficiency over the last 50k miles has been 4.0 miles/kWh. I like empirical data and things will probably get more efficient in the future, so let‚Äôs go with that.  Turning dead dinosaurs into physical movement:  Gasoline has an energy content of 33.7 kWh/gallon (https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_comparison_chart.pdf). Unfortunately, we have some losses when it comes to converting gasoline‚Äôs (or any other fuels) chemical energy into kinetic energy.  The main fossil fuels for electricity in the US are coal and natural gas (methane). ¬†The US Energy Information Administration publishes the following energy contents for those two fuels. Don‚Äôt worry too much about the units, we‚Äôll normalize all of this to gasoline pretty soon.  Coal: 9,544 btu/lbm  Natural Gas: 1,034 btu/ft^3  https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_07_03.html  In addition to the energy content of the fuel, we also need to take into account the amount of electricity that can be recovered from said fuel. There are billions of dollars of research committed to making these numbers as good as physical possible. It is easy to just gloss over them, but this is the real crux of the argument.  Coal: 10,465 btu/kWh  Natural Gas: 7,812 btu/kWh  https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html  The last piece of the puzzle is emission. Greenhouse gasses and their effect on our climate are real, but complicated. For ease of conversation, we are just going to look at CO2. If you don‚Äôt like that, fight me. Once again, the EIA uses your taxes to publish some great data.  Coal: 93.3 kg CO2/Million btu  Natural Gas: ¬†53.1 kg CO2/Million btu  https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_a_03.html  These energy numbers are all well and good, but there has to be some loss in all those power lines, right? The loss varies based on how far away from the plant you are, but in the US it is between about 3% and 10%. Let‚Äôs use 10%.  http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/  With that, we have enough data to calculate how your electric car is ruining the planet! Let‚Äôs do it! We are looking for miles/gallon and grams/mile, so let‚Äôs do some unit conversion.  Coal ‚Äì gasoline equivalence:  (9544btu/1lbm)(**1kWh/3412btu**)(1gal/33.7kWh)= **0.083** gallons of gasoline equivalent per pound of coal.  Coal ‚Äì mileage:  (9544btu/1lbm)(1kWh/10465btu)(1lbm/**0.083gal**)(4miles/kwh)(10% line loss)= **40 mpg.** Not bad for coal!  Coal ‚Äì emissions  (1kWh/4miles)(10465btu/1kWh)(1Mbtu/1000000btu)(93kg/1Mbtu)(1000g/1kg)= 243 grams/mile. Hmm‚Ä¶ not great.  Natural Gas ‚Äì gasoline equivalence:  (1034btu/1ft^3)(1kWh/**3412btu**)(1gal/33.7kWh)= **0.0089** gallons of gasoline equivalent per cubic foot of natural gas.  Natural Gas ‚Äì mileage:  (1034btu/1lbm)(1kWh/7812btu)(1lbm/**0.0089gal**)(4miles/kwh)(10% line loss)= **53.5 mpg**  Natural Gas ‚Äì emissions  (1kWh/4miles)(7812btu/1kWh)(1Mbtu/1000000btu)(53kg/1Mbtu)(1000g/1kg)= 103 grams/mile. Nice.  So a ‚Äúpurely coal powered‚Äù electric car has similar emissions to the EPA standards (it would fail as a car but pass as a light truck), but also gets 40 mpg... Damn good for the states.  A ‚Äúnatural gas only‚Äù electric car gets about 53 mpg but emits well under half of normal car emissions. A pretty strong nail in the ‚Äúelectric cars are dirty‚Äù coffin, and some (industry) analysis done in Germany is a nice reality check on our work: https://www.wingas.com/fileadmin/Wingas/WINGAS-Studien/Energieversorgung_und_Energiewende_en.pdf   ‚ÄúBut wait! Doesn‚Äôt the US get its power from a variety of sources?‚Äù you say? Well yes, it does. About 36% from natural gas, 28% from coal, 19% from nuclear, and 17% from various renewables (http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/). CO2 emissions and gasoline equivalents from nuclear and renewable are small enough to disregard in this analysis (citation needed). So in reality, an average electric car charged in the US would look like this:  Mileage:  (0.35x53.5mpg)(0.28x40mpg)(0.19x inf)(0.17x inf)= **75 mpg**  Emissions:  (0.35x243g/mi)(0.28x103g/mi)(0.19x0g/mi)(0.17x0g/mi)= 104 grams/mile  TL;DR  Unless your car gets **75 mpg** and emissions 2.5 times lower than EPA standards, an electric car is still better for the environment. This will only improve as the US moves away from coal and more towards more economical sources like natural gas and renewables.   Or just put some solar panels on your roof and bathe in your own smug-ness as you get infinite mpg and 0 emissions.  Bonus fact!  Gasoline and diesel fuels are not actually stable, and have a limited shelf life. Due to the extremely complicated extraction/production/distribution networks required to put gasoline in your car, all the ‚Äúpreppers‚Äù in the audience should REALLY be excited about electric vehicles and rooftop solar.

The Electric Car Will Not Save Us,"In China, the average salary hovers somewhere around $13,000 while a gallon of gas goes for $5.50.  Fill up a small thirteen gallon tank once and that's over $70 out of someone's monthly income of just over $1000.  Before taxes.  Clearly, electric which fractionizes these costs.  Even at China's high costs of electricity, at a rate of $0.54 a kilowatt, is low enough to cut this gas bill in half.  Someplace like America, filling an electric tank of similar range would be one one third or less than gasoline price.  China is going gangbusters for EVs, selling 6+ million this year.  Double that of last year.  Good news, right?  * https://cleantechnica.com/2022/09/16/71315-lithium-prices-reach-all-time-high/  Well, think about it for a moment.  Now cars buyers have options on fuel.  When gasoline looks too much, go EV.  When it swings cheaper, maybe buy a gasoline one.  And so it swings like a pendulum.  What has happened there with this choice?  The car paradigm extended itself and was granted longevity and an environmental reprieve.  People are less likely to buy an electric bike or scooter weighing less than 45kg/100lbs.  Now they go for a car that used to weigh less than 1,233kg (2,718lb) to one that weighs 1535kg (3,384) (electric) making streets wear and tear and tires degrade into microplastics that much faster.  Because they feel safer because the roads are made for cars and it's what everyone else is buying.  And so car culture lives for another day.  Instead of having 1.4 billion gasoline cars on the road.  Now we have 1.4 billion gasoline + 15 million EVs probably using mostly coal at the plug source.  As EV grows, so does the coal usage.  The Saudis and OPEC then no longer feel sure of their monopoly.  So they price oil cheaply.  And car culture grows again.  Perhaps by 2035, it will sink to 1.25 billion gasoline cars and 500 million EVs, mostly using coal.  Progress much?  Peak oil is no longer seen as a threat.  We have EVs.  If oil gets scarce or expensive, the rationale will go --even if that though is a misperception-- people will just jump onto EVs.  It's a nice mental parachute to fall back on.  So buy now and think later.  Not make a change in their fundamental lifestyle.  The car culture, thus self-assured, keeps going with both gasoline and EV and continually underinvesting in commuter and car-free environments.  And so, EVs will not save us from ourselves, just enable more of the same to which we have become accustomed for longer and export like a virus the world over.  It will ensure oil will get used long into future as the car ensures suburbia, hellscape cities with rush hours, big box stores, and is generally at the heart of modern consumption; the American Way of Life‚Ñ¢.  It will prevent environmental collapse just like [diet coke supports healthy eating and prevents obesity](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/10/07/1044010141/diet-soda-may-prompt-food-cravings-especially-in-women-and-people-with-obesity).",2022-11-16 14:57:42,2123,344,collapse

"Apple Cancels Work on Electric Car, Shifts Team to Generative AI","# Apple Cancels Work on Electric Car, Shifts Team to Generative AI  &#x200B;  * Company is winding down work on decade-old Project Titan * Employees on some car teams will move to Apple‚Äôs AI division  &#x200B;  [(Bloomberg)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986) \-- **Apple Inc. is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car**, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.  Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn‚Äôt public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.  The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car ‚Äî known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG ‚Äî will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.  The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It‚Äôs possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it‚Äôs unclear how many.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.  The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.  But the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team‚Äôs leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago ‚Äî following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.  The decision to wind down the project was finalized by Apple‚Äôs most senior executives in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached or a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.  Most recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company‚Äôs board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.  &#x200B;  sources;  [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986)  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada)  [https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/)  [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html)  [https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/)  [https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/](https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/)  [https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/)  [https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/](https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/)  [https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/)  [https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html)  [https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years](https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years)  [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html)  [https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626)  https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancellation-of-car-effort-boosts-urgency-of-bets-on-ai-headset-1.2040140",2024-02-27 19:29:59,1098,302,stocks

"Tesla Model 3 Highland, thoughts after 500 km","Hi, Picked up the tesla model 3 highland (RWD, 18"" wheels) last saturday and drove about 500 km with it the past weekend, also with rear passengers. For context, I have never sat in a Tesla before, nor driven one and I am a first time EV owner.  Here are my first thoughts and answers to frequent concerns:  - You get used to driving without stalks in about an hour. Initially roundabouts may feel a bit awkward however after using it for a bit you know where the buttons are. The steeringwheel buttons themselves are very tactile and feel close to normal buttons.  - Shifting is absolutely no problem using the screen, I actually prefer it over stalks but this might be subjective.  - Tesla Vision is pretty underwhelming in its current state and I wouldve preferred USS. I assume with software updates it will improve but as of now USS would've been better.  - The quality of the interior is very solid. It ofcourse isn't rollce royce quality but it is perfectly fitting for the price range.  - The ambient light does not reflect on the front window.  - The car is a lot of fun to drive but also very comfortable for everyone inside.   - The sound isolation is very good, and there is little road noise. Sunday night it was quite windy and at speeds below 130 km/h it was barely noticable.  - The suspension is great and I would say about medium to soft in stiffness. It clears speed bumps perfectly without discomfort.  - The speakers and microphone quality even in this spec (which I think has 9 speakers as opposed to the 17 speakers in the AWD) is exceptional.   - The voice assistant doesn't really work that well for the dutch language in my opinion. Also if you have a non traditional european name it seems to have difficulty understanding the name. I have yet to try the system out in English.  - The supercharger experience is insane and is in my opinion one of the big selling points for Tesla. It just works, no hassle, no manual payment and it is fast. From 10 to 60% took about 15 minutes.  All in all very happy with the purchase but there are some improvements possible which are luckily mostly software related.  Kind regards",2023-10-30 09:36:11,838,253,TeslaModel3
Am I silly for considering a Tesla Model 3?,"Warning - I know this post will sound like it belongs on r/personalfinance but they removed my post because they don‚Äôt allow conversations about expensive cars‚Ä¶? Anyway..  My wife and I just had our 22 year old car break down and the mechanic recommended we shouldn‚Äôt spend the money to get it fixed. So now we are in the market for a car. Here‚Äôs the relevant info to help point me in the right direction:   - I drive 310 miles a week for work   - we have no debt except for our home, which we have 120k left on the loan   - we have 30k in an emergency fund and 33k  in savings that we could put toward a car   - our other car is a 2013 Hyundai sonata with 120k miles   We are considering a Model 3 because I drive so much and the gas savings could be pretty significant. It seems like I‚Äôm the ideal kind of person for an EV with my commute distance, ability to charge at home and the fact that we don‚Äôt take long trips too often (and the trips we do take, we have another car we could use). I‚Äôm just not sure if it‚Äôs a good decision.   The cheapest Model 3 is $37,000 and I would be eligible for the $7,500 tax rebate, so paying less than 30k for this car sounds great to me, but I‚Äôd love to hear some opinions.

Somewhat regret buying a new 2023 Tesla Model 3,"&#x200B;  I bought a new 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD in December 2023 mainly because:  * Federal Tax Credit * New York Incentive * Est. 3 Year gas savings, etc  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/8okt0cgsab8c1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=519d3b9a323ff7e36a0724df171f0a87018535e6  However I somewhat regret buying a Tesla as it cost too much to insure.  My previous car was 2021 Honda Clarity and I paid $684 for 6 months full coverage insurance from Geico here at Long Island, New York USA.  Now with the Tesla my Geico insurance premium is $1,245.80 /6 months  I realized reading this article-  [https://www.valuepenguin.com/tesla-car-insurance#:\~:text=Show%20All%20Rows-,Why%20are%20Teslas%20so%20expensive%20to%20insure%3F,other%20luxury%20or%20electric%20vehicles](https://www.valuepenguin.com/tesla-car-insurance#:~:text=Show%20All%20Rows-,Why%20are%20Teslas%20so%20expensive%20to%20insure%3F,other%20luxury%20or%20electric%20vehicles).  Some quotes from this article:  * Electric cars are more expensive to repair and insure because they have more expensive equipment and technology. * Teslas can only be repaired at Tesla-approved body repair shops. The training and equipment to become qualified means much higher costs for drivers.  That's why the cost to repair a Tesla, even for a minor fender bender, can easily reach several thousand dollars. As the cars include more custom parts, safety features and technology, the cost per collision may continue to rise.  I wish their was a method to see what it would cost to insure a new car before buying it.  Does anyone in New York have a Tesla Model 3 RWD? If yes how much does it cost to insure your Tesla? and who's the insurance company?  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  Update: 12/27/2023 Thanks everyone for your replies, I called several insurance companies and all gave me higher rates than GEICO. A few insurance agents have said too many accidents have occurred at southern New York that has caused insurance rates to rise significantly. Some are not doing new policies and some insurance companies will not insure a Tesla.   These are the insurance rates I got for full coverage of my Tesla M3:  &#x200B;  |  Company|  Cost| |:-|:-| |  State Farm|  $1444 /6 months| |  Liberty Mutual|  $4,044.50 /6 months $8,089 per year| |  Travelers|  $1,426 /6 months| |  Nationwide |  No new auto insurance policies in NY| |  Erie|  $1,812.02 /6 months  $3,824 per year| |  Esurance| Insurance rep said check with Allstate| |  Allstate|  $2,264 /6 months| |  Costco Connect|  $2,149 /6 months| |  Progressive|  Will not insure Tesla | |  GEICO|  $1,245.80 /6 months|  As a result, of high insurance cost I'm selling my Tesla within 6 months.   I'm eyeing on these Tesla M3 alternatives:  * 2024 Volvo EX30 Starting at $34,950 MSRP\* * 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV MSRP STARTING AT: $34,995 * 2024 Hyndai Kona Electric $32,675 * 2024 Prius Prime $32,675  Once these cars are available will check out the insurance cost, incentives before buying.  &#x200B;",2023-12-24 21:33:29,8,121,TeslaModel3

My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a ""paid big oil shill"" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE.  Everything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today.  And yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there.  # EV performance & its accessibility  I'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the ""pure acceleration"" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.  And how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds. The amount of ""stuff"" involved between your right foot and the tires is a joke compared to an ICE car. And it's basically idiot-proof - even with the Track Mode dialed to 100% hoon in my TM3P, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake. You just put your foot down and the car takes care of the rest, with literally zero drama.  # Electric motors are great  And all of this performance comes with no mechanical sympathy. I never felt an ounce of it, flogging my Model 3 - there's really nothing to ""break"" mechanically in the way of the drivetrain. The entire drive unit consists of the motor, a few gears, the diff, a pump to circulate the oil... and that's really about it. No fried clutches, exploding transmissions, shredded differentials, etc... it's always ready to pounce at any speed, in any situation. Electric motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, quiet, clean, tough, extremely efficient, insanely long-lasting, and have an excellent power/size ratio. When it comes to to the task of turning energy into mechanical force, I'm not sure there's anything better.  AND! You don't even have to worry about getting the motors up to operating temperature before you get on it. During the colder months, it easily takes 10+ minutes of highway driving for the oil of an ICE to warm up (you are looking at your oil and not the coolant temp, right?). I quite enjoyed leaving my neighborhood with the ability to give it full ""throttle"" right out of the gate. It's like teleporting straight into any 3-car gap, no matter where. (But there are limitations to this - more on that later, too.)  # Convenience & running costs  You can also have your cake and eat it, too! There's no need to feel like a moron with a 550 HP ICE engine idling under the hood in daily stop and go traffic. My TM3P was an efficient, calm, quiet, easy, comfortable way of getting from Point A to Point B while being more similar performance-wise to a BMW M3 than a Toyota Corolla - with fewer running costs than either. True, the suspension, brakes, thermal management gubbins, etc., are largely synonymous between an EV and ICE. But when it comes to the actual propulsion, there's basically zero wear and tear. Just a dumb motor that doesn't care about much, and will probably last well past 1 million miles. With a new battery, you're basically looking at a brand-new drivetrain.  And yes, running on electricity is cheaper than filling up an ICE car - this is where most of the EV ""savings"" materialize. In my experience, electricity in the mid-Atlantic region cost roughly 12¬¢/kWh and 9¬¢/kWh in the PNW. For my TM3P, that equates to about $10 and $8 in each region, respectively, to travel \~265 miles, assuming: A 75 kWh battery pack, lifetime consumption average of 280 Wh/mile, and a 13% charging loss, **IF** you can charge at home (which is key to the ""get in and go"" convenience of an EV - without that, forget it). Subtract oil + filter changes, spark plugs, failing chain tensioners, bad oxygen sensors, burnt out cat converters, and other annoying problems, and the running costs quickly stack up in the EV's favor. You rarely even use the brakes! Even with the initial purchase price of an EV still being notably higher than gasoline, on average, you can make the argument that it still comes out cheaper in the long run. But the wildcard here is ""how long is 'long run?'""  The cost of battery pack replacement isn't discussed as often as I'd like. Some of the earliest Model S packs are already starting to fail - only about 10 years later. When I sold my E46, it was approaching 20 years old. It still faithfully serves its new owner on a daily basis, today. Maybe I've only heard about the edge cases, and the Model 3's will all last considerably last longer, but I personally never got comfortable being part of a beta test. The batteries in these cars remain a delicate subject, which brings us to the poo-poo part of this post.  # Let's face it - batteries still suck.  Electric motors are one thing; powering them is an entirely different story. Conventional lithium-ion batteries are really the only currently viable way to power EVs en masse. Part of what makes them great is that they're extremely efficient when it comes to storing and dispensing energy - especially compared to fossil fuels and other solutions in the works. You put electricity in, electricity comes back out. The leap from energy generation to use is extremely short. But they do have notable limitations around longevity, performance, and cost, especially when it comes to shuffling a 2+ ton vehicle around. Whether you're willing to accept these limitations is up to you.  **Degradation is inevitable**  At this point, the oldest Model Ss on the road at about 10 years old. Although the Model 3 pack is newer and has less cells (thus less to go wrong - 7,920 in the Plaid vs 4,416 in a TM3 LR), we don't yet have enough information to truly know what to expect from these packs from a longevity perspective. Unlikely that Tesla will ever share this info, either. If Elon is to be believed, the Model 3 pack should last 300,000 - 500,000 miles. If Elon is to be believed, fully-autonomous cars would've been shuffling us around long before 2020. We know that with proper care, pretty much any modern ICE car should be able to surpass the 250,000 mile mark without many problems. So anyone who likes to run their cars for as long as possible and buys an EV should know that they're venturing into the unknown.  Yes, I'm aware that there are examples out there of Model Ss surpassing several hundred thousand miles - with the caveat being that a not-insignificant number of them of them involved battery and/or drive unit replacements at various points. There are also Hyundai Elantras out there with 1,000,000+ miles on their original powertrains.  But note that degradation is only one part of the story. Upon my departure of Tesland, I can't recall hearing of anyone replacing packs due to natural degradation. All the replacement stories I came across were pack failures in one form or another. Yes, the internet is a fantastic place for angry people to vent, and it could be that the population's negatively skewed - like the Finnish guy who recently blew up his Model S on YouTube. But the reality is that if one single cell - not brick, not module, but **cell** \- fails, the pack is done. That cell turns into a parasite. The car will struggle and ultimately fail to balance out the pack, eventually giving up one morning, telling you to GFY, and to take it to Tesla. Last I heard, replacing the battery on a Model S was \~$24,000 and \~$16,000 for a Model 3. This is just one type of sudden pack failure that I've heard about, and what makes it especially concerning is that the root cause seems fairly trivial relative to the catastrophe that ensues. Maybe it's overblown and maybe I'm being paranoid, but the chances of this happening are real, and only increase in with age...  ...which is something else that affects battery degradation, as indicated by Tesla's latest shenanigan of selling ""new"" cars with batteries from 4+ year-old stock, claiming that range ""may be reduced by 12%."" (At the time of this writing: Model 3 SR drive unit + battery warranty is 8 years/100,000 miles, LR is 8 years/120,000 miles). So yes, the car is literally getting worse every day by the sheer virtue of just sitting there - especially in extreme climates. How pronounced is the impact of age vs. use vs. fast-charging is anybody's guess, but it's a reality that needs to be acknowledged.  So if you're comfortable with basically ending up with a 2 - 3 ton paperweight if some electrical fault appears in the pack, and have the means to shovel cash into the Tesla furnace without much concern for what the future may hold, then you're probably less worried about the battery. I envy your fortitude and tolerance for risk - it's something I thought I could swallow, but couldn't. As I learned these realities, I became increasingly less comfortable with the prospect of keeping the car past its warranty period. Yes, an ICE can also fail (a timeworn Tesla fanatic argument), but not many ICE failures end in the car being completely inoperable - especially in modern cars which are ridiculously reliable and serviceable by anyone.  **Mitigation means sacrifice**  If you want the battery to last as long as possible, you have to be nice to it.  You don't want to leave the battery fully-charged for extended periods of time, or let it drop below 10% - there are arguments that doing either of these is more detrimental to battery longevity than supercharging. But this is why the 90 - 100% block on a Tesla's charge indicator is labeled ""Trip."" (I don't think any other manufacturers do this... And part of me wonders whether it's a Teslan strategy to maximize rated range.) So right off the batt (ha), you're 20% down if you're concerned for battery health. It's OK to charge to 100% right before a long trip, but the lower, the better, around town. There are people who charge to 90%, 80%, or even lower on a daily basis as a result. Jeff Dahn recommends 70% to maximize life - you can look him up. Now, paying $50K+ for a vehicle like this and running it below its potential for most of its life just... sucks. Especially seeing as the car produces its maximum power output only at about 90%+ state of charge (SoC).  That's right. Until they develop a battery that behaves like it's filled with a liquid, this is going to remain a reality. Batteries are only at their best when they're charged to 90 - 100% of their capacity. This becomes especially noticeable at highway speeds at a low SoC, since EVs accelerate far more brutally from a stop than from a roll. The car is still **plenty** quick on the highway, but this does result in some ass-clenching moments when passing cars on a divided yellow and you're used to driving around in God Mode. You put your foot down at <30% SoC @ 55 mph, expecting one response, but get quite another. (Disclaimer: Although this is a battery reality, it's also a byproduct of the car having a single gear - no motor can rev to infinity.)  Batteries also do *not* like extreme temperature. Batteries are like people - they're most comfortable at the temperatures we're most comfortable - right around 70¬∞F. This impacts **both** their output and charging. So in the cold, they do not want to charge, and they do not want to give you full power. When it's *extremely* cold, expect to lose 30 - 40% of your range thanks to this convenient little truth, combined with the fact that you're probably running the heat. In lower temperatures, my Model 3's ""acceleration/regen"" indicator frequently told me that the car was both power-limited and/or regen-limited because of a cold-soaked battery. What does ""cold"" mean? I don't know - and seems to change with software updates. Towards the end of my ownership, it seemed that the car sitting overnight in the high 40s/low 50s was enough to result in power limiting to protect the battery. Preheating the car before departure mitigates this problem, which eats into your range unless you're plugged in. (Note that Tesla also recently updated the Model 3 with a heat pump vs. a resistive heater, which sounds like it's notably helped with cold weather driving range. However, initial accounts of how this affects cold weather power output were mixed, as cabin HVAC and battery were both effectively ""competing"" for scavenging what little heat was available. Whether or not these problems have since been remedied, I'm not sure.)  **Performance (with caveats)**  Excessive heat also presents problems. Since an ICE vehicle's engine is operating at about 212¬∞F, the ambient temperature differential is generally more than enough to provide cooling. Even temps of 100¬∞F+ provide plenty of space to act as a sink. But when ""hot"" is closer to \~120¬∞F, as in for a Li-ion battery, things get a bit more challenging. Obviously this won't be a relevant problem for 99.98% of people, but it is an issue if you're planning on sustained high-performance driving. I think the problem is \*almost\* solved through aftermarket components like larger radiators and auxiliary cooling pumps, but as of my leaving the community a number of months ago, it was still an issue for the Model 3, even in cooler temperatures. (Whether they've solved this with the Plaid, I'm not sure - I don't know if anyone's been able to run it for long enough prior to overcooking the horribly insufficient brakes and/or tires.) And if you are planning on tracking your Model 3, anticipate something like <60 miles of track driving range because of an EV's sensitivity to stress, and the simple fact that the car isn't really carrying that much energy on board.  Look up Jason Fenske's Engineering Explained video on battery density on YouTube for an excellent explanation of this. It boils down to the fact that a gallon of gasoline has roughly 13x the energy density than the best of modern Li-ion batteries by volume - and we're strictly talking about the cells here. I.e., it doesn't take into account the fact that there are a lot of other things that need to surround those cells to get them to actually do their job in an EV. The battery pack in a Long Range Model 3 weighs roughly 1,000 lbs... All of the energy contained within equates to roughly 2.2 gallons of gasoline. Which also has the added benefit of being extremely portable, should you find yourself off the beaten path. Try carrying that much energy in batteries by hand... Hope you brought a spare car.  But that's not the entire story. Yes, EVs do put more of that energy into forward motion than an ICE. But this excellent efficiency is also precisely the reason why EV racing isn't going to approach the length of conventional races any time soon. I'm too dumb to explain it in mathematical terms, but since EVs are so efficient, every ""stressor"" they experience has a disproportionate impact on their range vs. a similar ICE vehicle. The best ICE engines on the road today are something like 35 - 40% efficient, which means that 60 - 65% of the energy in the fuel is basically wasted as heat vs. propulsion. So any kind of ""fast"" or aggressive driving is going to have an exponential impact on an EV's range.  I *never* saw the quoted ""310 miles of range"" that's on the sticker of the Model 3 - and this was on the standard, hateful 18"" MXM4s that came with the car. At one point I ran into a former colleague at my local Tesla service center who was there to discuss that very issue - ""I'm not getting 300+ miles on the highway?"" Yep. The girl at the counter told him the same thing. ""That's normal - anything above 70 MPH is going to dramatically decrease your range."" If you look on the forums, generally speaking, the lifetime average consumption that many people are getting hovers around 280 Wh/mile. If you drive like a nance, this number will obviously improve, but if you're on this forum... I'm guessing you drive a bit more spiritedly than that.  To accommodate said spirited driving, I decided to up the car's OEM 235 tires (that's what the new Civic SI comes with, except it's 1,200 lbs lighter) to 265 PS4Ss and installed a set of KW coilovers. As a result of the aforementioned sensitivity, I knew my range would take a hit... but I wasn't quite prepared for how much. One morning while taking my wife to the airport, I said ""ok, I'm just going to drive this like I used to drive the BMW."" Temps were in the upper 40s/lower 50s, heated seats on, cabin heat on low, averaging 70-ish mph on the highway with one passenger + her luggage. On return, I calculated that my range would've come out to roughly **200 miles.** As many Tesla evangelists would argue, ""well, dass enuff range"" and sure, in most situations, that's probably true. But for me, personally, this added another layer of  anxiety that made any form of enthusiastic driving feel like a sin. There are rumors out there that the Model 3 was literally designed around the wheels and tires, and after experiencing that, I'm inclined to believe it.  So when people talk about using EVs to tow over extended distances, I'm not exactly sure how that's gonna fly. Especially with heavy/large loads, and considering that such vehicles will need charging stations spacious enough to accommodate them on long-haul trips. And I don't care about this ""o well X% of people don't tow past Y miles."" I just don't. EV forums are filled with tiresome ""oh you don't need that"" arguments that are somehow supposed to enshroud the fact that for many people, an EV would result in a step backwards when it comes to utility. Anyway, that brings us to everyone's favorite subject - charging infrastructure!  # Do you have a place to charge?  At the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla. And this is assuming you're sticking to generally well-traveled paths in fair-weather conditions. That's because when you buy a Tesla, you're also buying into their supercharger network. The whole experience is generally pretty good - you simply drive up to the charger, plug in your car, and that's it. (Admittedly, I don't have experience with any other EV fast charging, but from what I've heard and seen, it's spotty, at best.)  When you go off the beaten path, that's when things get a little dicey. Every time we went somewhere a little ""unique,"" I'd have to carefully think about what type of range I could expect given the weather conditions and if it was realistic to make a round-trip without buggin'. Expect your ""real"" range in a big-battery Model 3 to be more like \~250 miles on the OEM wheels and tires in good weather. It's true that the car will most likely beat 310 miles in city driving, where EV range is amazing, but that's quite a narrow use case that would take literally all day. Then again, I never actually heard of anyone ""running out of battery"" on the road (in which case your only recourse is to tow the car), but it is a little uncomfortable to read about various close calls, like people trying to keep their families from freezing to death in 10¬∞F weather with the heater sucking down 3 kW, sitting in 3+ hours of traffic. The car does its damndest to keep you from running out, though, triggering warnings to reduce your speed or telling you that you're driving into a ""supercharger desert"" if it calculates that you're living on the edge.  So if you do end up traveling into a supercharger desert, with only third-party and destination chargers to rely on, you have to be prepared to ask yourself several questions:  1. Is there charging? 2. Is it accessible to you? Or is it purely for clients of an establishment, etc.? 3. Is it compatible? Different standards *do* exist, which is genuinely infuriating if we're gonna get serious about electrified personal transport. This isn't a fucking cellphone. As far as I know, third-party fast charging for Teslas is either sketchy at the moment, or nowhere near as powerful as a 150+ kW supercharger. (By the way, melting a J1772 adapter for a Tesla at any third-party chargers is not uncommon. Ask me how I know.) 4. Is it powerful enough to get you the range you need in the time you have to charge? 5. Are you willing to pay the price? A lot of these places are no longer free. Some cost a ridiculous amount for simple Level 2 charging, which is basically like someone asking you to pay for using a dryer outlet. 6. Is it even going to be available? If it's open parking or it's saturated with other EVs, you might have to wait. If it's Level 2, you're probably doomed.  Only if you can answer ""Yes"" to those with confidence are you good-to-go. And while it's true that the ""gas savings"" are real, many people don't seem to be factoring in the charging losses I mentioned earlier. Estimate 10 - 15% losses for charging, meaning that you're consuming more electricity than what actually makes it into the pack. These charging losses get worse in extreme temperatures - up to 40% in cold weather. You still come out ahead, but it's an important fact to note if we're going to be honest with ourselves. And the assumption underpinning that argument is always that you are charging at home - a reality that only exists for something like 40% of the American driving public. Charging at a supercharger costs more.  Even if fast-charging the battery wasn't detrimental to its health, it's not like there's a supercharging station on every corner. Building superchargers costs a lot of money, it's not as simple as just ""tapping into the local supercharger line."" You'll notice that at every station, there's huge enclosed devices turning massive amounts of electricity into DC power. I've heard that Tesla doesn't run these as profit centers, and I do think the pricing to supercharge is very reasonable, but it's still not free (unless you get this incentive) - so charging at a supercharger costs roughly the same in ""fuel"" as driving an econobox.  And as batteries continue getting better and better, as they will, keep in mind that a kWh of energy is a kWh of energy. A theoretical 1 MW pack in a theoretical Tesla semi is going to need a supercharger that outputs about 4x the power of today's fastest superchargers to get to where it's going in any reasonable amount of time. If we imagine some super magic battery that's 50 MW and weighs 1 ton, it's not like you'll be able to charge that on a dryer outlet. You need serious power infrastructure on the other side of that battery to make it practical. I'd imagine that powering sustained commercial flight someday, for example, would basically require airports build their own dedicated power plants. Admittedly I have no clue how difficult or easy this is, but I'm sure there's an army of electrical engineers frothing at the keyboard to add to this point.  # From an enthusiast's perspective...  I've already scratched the surface of this, but I'd like to take a moment to talk about my TM3P strictly from an enthusiast's standpoint. There's a lot of stereotypes out there about Tesla owners, and while it is true that many of them have never seen a flathead screwdriver, there's also a substantial number of them coming from high-performance BMWs, Porsche 911s, Dodge Hellcats, McLarens, etc. A good number of them claim that the TM3P is the ""most fun"" car they've ever owned, and that's great, but I guess fun means different things to different people.  I genuinely feel like two years of driving this car has made me a dumber and less engaged driver. I can't quite put my finger on the root of it - I think it's some combination of no noise, no gears, not using the brakes 98% of the time, and the experience of owning a car that basically does everything for you. For most people, unfortunately, that's probably exactly what they want... but not me. I want to be involved. For most of my life, given the cars I've owned, the journey's always at least been *some* part of the reward. And with the Tesla, I can't say that I ever really ""looked forward"" to driving it. It was  such a seamless and uninvolving experience that it just kind of faded into the background as a simple means to an end, rather than something engaging and fun to look forward to.  And it's not for lack of capability. With coilovers, sways, various control arms, and wheels + tires, my TM3P was razor sharp and scary quick in any given situation. At auto-xs, I was able to hang with seasoned veterans driving Cayman GT4s equipped with track tires. But even then, as I was getting thrown about the cabin on the sofa-like seat (seriously - most comfortable seats of any car I've ever driven), I couldn't help but feel that something was still missing, and it runs deeper than the difference between ""fun"" and ""exciting.""  I don't think it's necessarily down to the fact that I grew up driving with both hands and both feet. A while ago I got a Hyundai Kona AWD as a rental. I had a ton of fun throwing that thing around... maybe more fun than I'd ever had in my Tesla. (As Jeremy Clarkson says - the fastest car in the world is the rental car.) Coming to this tragic realization was a big red flag for me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, at \~4,100 lbs, it's still a a fat-ass car, and the weight was an ever-present part of the experience? Or it starts life as a comfortable family sedan? But then again, so does the M3. I can't for sure pin it down to one thing, but at the end of the day I never really ""felt"" and enjoyed the Tesla in the same way I felt and enjoyed my '99 Miata.  # Tesla and the EV community  This is the part where I rage about Tesla and will probably ruffle some feathers. Too bad.  Let me start off by saying that the service center (SC) employees are generally awesome - at least the one in my local SC. Tesla's engineers are brilliant, too. And it's refreshing to see a novel approach to building a car, where all the systems are so tightly integrated that everything feels ""whole"" vs. a bunch of different fiefdoms colliding into one car at the very end. And they're truly being innovative beyond just the fact that they're making EVs - Elon's woken up to the fact that manufacturing is no joke, and it sounds like they're doing their damnedest to make strides in this area as well. I wouldn't be surprised if ultimately their innovations in manufacturing outweigh their innovations everywhere else.  But I think all of their issues stem from dog-shit, stubborn management, rushing and not thinking things through carefully, an engineering-first approach, and Elon - a guy I can respect, but could use a serious ass-kicking once or twice.  Their quality control is abhorrent - we already know that. Model Ys being delivered with windshields not bonded into place is my favorite recent example. But the materials themselves are nothing to write home about, either. It's not bargain-basement bad, but the Model 3/Y certainly do *not* feel like $45K+ cars, except to clueless new owners who are just getting interested in cars for the first time. This really hit home for me the first time I cleaned my Model 3's interior - the carpets are literally like a glorified version of glovebox liner. The lauded ""vegan leather"" seats don't seem so great, either - look up the headrest bubbling issue on the Model 3. Which is an excellent segue into the mentality of \*some\* Tesla fanatics.  Before we dive into this, let's be clear - The **vast** majority of owners, as usual, are just normal people who don't care. Every car brand has its own subset of narrow-minded insufferable people who will die defending it, no matter what. What makes this subset of Tesla peeps especially unbearable is that they genuinely believe that they are saving the planet and have elevated Tesla to something more of a deity than a car company. So there's this undercurrent of holiness that accompanies the entire sphere and makes the proselytizing that much more infuriating. *""Ew, ICE engines, what a stupid design!""* Yeah. Our civilization got to where it is on AAA batteries!  But that's easy to ignore. The copious amounts of mental gymnastics going on in the community is what's truly saddening. I remember coming across one topic where a guy with a Model X was wondering how he was going to take his family on a ski trip past a supercharger desert in the Northeast. They bought a bunch of 12V heated blankets to avoid running the heat. This is a $100K+ SUV we're talking about.  I came across countless other such examples where fashionable forfeiture serves as justification for buying into a nascent technology - ""Who needs to drive more than 200 miles, anyway?"" False analogies are rampant, also - ""ICE cars overheat too!"" - often in irrelevant comparisons largely due to being an established technology. There was one guy who was worried about using the heat in the wintertime and its impact on range. Someone replied and told him that he wasn't dressing appropriately for the weather.  Back to the vegan leather headrest, otherwise known as ""plastic."" (It's hilarious watching two camps of environmentalists collide - on one end, the bovine enthusiasts. On the other, the guys thinking they're saving the planet in a $100K+ EV carrying around 1,300 lbs+ in batteries.) Something similar started happening to mine, both on driver and passenger sides. Getting it replaced under warranty is hit and miss, because Tesla. According to this vocal minority in the Tesla community, it was, of course, my fault. Not that I'd damaged it intentionally, but that ""some hair products tend to do this"" (hint: I use none) or ""some people's body oils degrade car interiors"" (hint: No car I've ever owned has exhibited this problem, ever. Wife is a completely different race from me, same issue - the fact that I even feel the need mention this is ridiculous). One guy went as far as telling me that the problem was that I was using the headrest as a headrest. OK!  EV blogs like electrek and insideEVs are especially abhorrent. Even as a new owner in my honeymoon phase, I stopped reading those a few months into my ownership. Articles are not written from the perspective of ""is Tesla great?"" but rather ""how great is Tesla, exactly?""  Servicing a Tesla is also an exercise in patience. A number of crucial components like batteries and drive units are ""restricted."" As a DIYer who keeps cars for a long time, this is extremely concerning in the way of Right to Repair. Rich Rebuilds goes on about this. But the company is in no rush to build and support an ecosystem of third-party repair, beyond bullshit like rotating tires. With any other regular car, there's an army of mechanics waiting to serve you should you run into problems.  Finally, the whole ""software as a car"" thing is great - up to a point. It's sort of a double-edged sword. Towards the end of my ownership, my Model 3 started developing this strange intermittent bug that wouldn't let the car go to sleep. So it would inexplicably rip through 1.5% of its battery every hour, just sitting there in the parking lot. No way to tell this was happening. I'd just get into the car the next day and see that the range had gone down considerably overnight. Seeing that issue develop and become increasingly common was very concerning, especially knowing the entropy that can accompany the software lifecycle and Tesla's QC standards. It's one thing to have a bug in your nav, it's quite another when a bug can affect its fundamental operation as A CAR. And with OTA updates, don't assume that just because something works today, it will also work tomorrow. So even though the car is absolutely brilliant in the snow, I never took it skiing, for fear of returning to not only a cold-soaked battery, but also a surprise decrease in available range.  And let's not even get into Full Self-Driving. Anyone who thinks that **truly** self-driving cars are anywhere on this side of 50 years will be sorely disappointed. I genuinely feel for the people plopping down $10K for this feature and hope it's mere pocket change in their world.  And the yoke? lol  # It's up to you.  If the downsides that I've laid out here are within your tolerance limits, and you're willing to bear the risk of being an early adopter, nobody can fault you for going with a BEV if it fits your lifestyle and needs. The Model 3, at the end of the day, is still a fantastic car for regular daily driving, for a lot of people.  Do I think this is the end of EVs for me? No. Maybe for the time being, but I think that in 15 - 20 years, there will be far more well-rounded EVs on the market - battery or otherwise. The potential benefits purely from an ownership/convenience perspective are too great to ignore. And I do think that with their skateboard design, allowing them to ""circumvent"" the pedestrian safety regulations that have absolutely ruined the aesthetics of modern cars, EVs also have the potential to make cars beautiful again.  I went into my Model 3 ownership experience with an open mind, and I genuinely learned a lot and have absolutely zero regrets about my experience. But in the end, I couldn't overlook its shortcomings, as I perceived them, for one simple reason: I just never fell in love with it. For you, things might be different.  Happy New Year and let the internet rage begin!",2021-12-31 01:29:04,3726,1160,cars

Tesla Model 3 Highland,"Today I visited the Tesla Center and I was sitting in the new Model 3 Highland.  I thought it should be better than my 2023 Tesla Model 3. But it turned out that the new car looks a lot cheaper.  Everywhere there is ordinary textile material that gets dirty very quickly. There is also a lot more cheap plastic. The car doesn't look as cool inside as it used to.  The passenger screen is very small and very reflective. Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions, but I didn't like it at all.

I drove one of these back in 2020 and although it was very fast and spacious for 4 passengers with boot and frunk I found it very noisy at/over 70mph, bouncy ride at times and in ecomode it drives like a 15 year old Prius. Don't like the Essex spec either so at ¬£45k at the time it was madness but now at ¬£16k for a 4 year old Tesla with 60k miles on the clock it seems like a real bargain considering the still very high current pricings on the used market right now.

Rented a Tesla Model 3 from Hertz for weekend: My Experience,"A bit of background about myself. I'd never driven an EV prior to yesterday. My only exposure to driver assistance features was in a 2021 Subaru Outback which I owned for 1.5 years in which I used the lane centering and adaptive cruise features extensively (both highways and city streets). I sold the Subaru for a $1,500 profit a few months ago due to the crazy market and I'm using my old 2005 Toyota Camry. I decided to have some fun with my 15 year old son this weekend so we rented a Tesla. I'm also seriously considering purchasing one in the next year or so. Here's our experience so far:  * We got the Tesla with a 93 percent charge, but I arrived for my appointment 30 minutes early so it probably would have been charged to 100 percent. They were very straightforward and friendly. * They require an 80 percent charge upon return or they'll charge a fee which is an obvious attempt to gouge the customer. * We only got a quick introduction to the car from the Hertz representative but that's because I insisted I watched tons of videos, etc. Once my son and I were left on our own, we were lost for about 15 minutes just trying to find the general screen for the controls, etc. I wanted to put the rental agreement in the glove box, and that took like 5 minutes. * After using the car for several hours, the layout for the features and controls is getting to seem natural and second nature. I'm not finding the lack of buttons and knobs in the cabin to be an issue whatsoever, and if anything it should make it easy to clean the car on car wash days. * **Autopilot Positives:** This is a big deal for me! The idea of taking long road trips on the highway and letting the car manage the braking/acceleration and steering is awesome. Compared to my Subaru with Eyesight, the autosteer (lane centering) on the Tesla is MUCH more capable. The Tesla can handle very tight curves on highways and on backroads that the Subaru would have immediately disengaged on. Also, pressing down twice on the stalk to engage the system is much easier than the three separate buttons I need to engage on the Subaru to initially engage the system (once the system was engaged, it was easy to reengage). * **Autopilot Negatives:** The positives of the autopilot system are impressive, but so far I've found significant drawbacks. Every 15 to 25 seconds the system requires me to put pressure on the wheel which is understandable. However, it doesn't sense the pressure I put, and I'm putting a decent amount of back and forth pressure on the steering wheel. Usually the system eventually recognizes the pressure, but sometimes I inadvertently force myself out of autopilot and have to tap down twice on the stalk to go back in. This is really distracting and takes away from the experience. To make matters worse, twice I've had this incredible obnoxious message come up indicating I was locked out of autopilot for the rest of the ride. I'm putting pressure on the wheel. I'm an alert and active driver. I know how to use these systems. Stop fucking around and let me enjoy my drive. So yeah, these is a serious distraction. * **Autopilot Negatives Cont:** I'm lumping the adaptive cruise feature into the autopilot umbrella for convenience. Overall I like the adaptive cruise feature on the Tesla, but the system on the Subaru is MUCH MUCH better. On the Tesla I feel like I'm too close to cars sometimes despite supposedly having 7 different distance settings. On the Subaru, I could totally set the adaptive to be too close for comfort but I could also set it too stupidly far. Also, the Tesla seems to lack refinement. If I'm coming up on a vehicle going 25 MPH slower than me, it seems to wait longer than it needs to to begin to slow down which makes the braking more abrupt. The Subaru would begin to slow the car much earlier and make the 25 MPH decline in speed seem almost unnoticeable. Mind you, I didn't feel ""unsafe"" with the way Tesla handled these situations, it just seemed more abrupt and therefore significantly less refined and less comfortable to the driver and passenger. * **Autopilot Negatives Cont:** When changing lanes, you need to reengage autopilot. That is obviously done on purpose so you'll pay $6K for the upgraded autopilot. So here's why this really sucks. With the Subaru, I could have lane centering with adaptive cruise set to 85 MPH and be behind somebody going 60 MPH in the slow lane. I'd hit my left blinker and the Subaru would already begin to increase RPMs to prepare for the pass! By the time I got into the left lane, not only would lane centering and adaptive cruise still be active, the car would already be accelerating to pass the car! And, once you pass the car, right blinker, move back to the slow lane, and everything still remains engaged! You get none of that experience with Tesla autopilot. It keeps the adaptive cruise engaged but it doesn't pass nearly as well or as seamlessly, and the system doesn't work nearly as conveniently. * **Rain Sensing Wipers:** Me and windshield wipers have a long history of mutual hate. I have never used a wiper system I've liked. Not once. I can never get my Toyota wipers to match rain fall satisfactory and the Subaru was no better. None of the cars I owned ever were. I would resort to pressing up on the wiper stalk to manually manage the wipers on my own! Well yesterday we had rain, and the rain varied. It would rain hard, it would rain soft, I would rain medium, and it would change rapidly in terms of value of rainfall. I'll be damned if that wiper system didn't perfectly handle matching the speed of the wipers to the amount of rain fall in real time. Seriously, it did it better than I could have done. The hilarious part is I didn't know the Tesla had a system, so for like an hour I was using the controls on the screen and bitching about how it was worse because I had to press a screen instead of using controls on the steering wheel. At one point, it started to rain and the wipers began moving on their own and I was like...no fucking way! So yeah, color me impressed!  **Updates below here.....**  * **Autopilot cont:** The volume knob scroll wheel ""hack"" worked so well I never bothered trying to find the right pressure on the steering wheel. I still have the car for the rest of this evening until 5 PM tomorrow (but I work tomorrow) so I'll still give it a try. I have to say the volume knob scroll wheel ""hack"" worked so well it's slightly better than applying pressure on the Subaru was. You add that with autopilot's ability to recognize lines and steer around steep curves, and it makes for a great system....but but.....we are about the enter the land of controversy, I have a feeling! * **Autopilot CONTROVERSY:** I'm just telling you an experience as it unfolds. This is not an opinion. My experience today is what happened, don't blame the messenger. I'm going to give specific parameters where this event took place so those in the area are welcome to give it a try. The location was State Highway 50 from Pueblo, CO to Florence CO and back again. This stretch of highway is extremely straight and in the plains of semiarid open space where one can see for miles. The first negative event occurred was a pedestrian walking along the shoulder of the highway, well to the far edge of the shoulder away from the highway. The Tesla promptly reduced speed and slowed down about 8 MPH before I began to accelerate and take over. Beyond that, I experienced minor phantom braking on the trip to Florence, CO. On the way back, I was following a motorcycle that was actually gradually gaining distance on me. During this period of time I experienced some severe phantom breaking that occurred 4 separate times. The last time I got really pissed and disengaged cruise control altogether and drove the rest of the way on my own accord. Oh, to add salt to the wound, my Subaru could do that stretch of highway perfectly including seeing the lines, steering (not a lot of turns) and managing the braking and accelerating flawlessly. This wasn't a hard section of highway, and I expected the Tesla to eat it for breakfast but that is not what happened. * **Driving Experience:** The driving experience is awesome freakin awesome! When I first got the car, I was slightly overwhelmed. The steering seemed too aggressive but changing it the comfort addressed that. At first the regenerative braking was set to the highest setting, and that was absolutely a ""no go"", I set it to the least aggressive which was ""roll"" I think. But, after getting used to everything, setting the regenerative braking to the most aggressive setting ""hold"" not only helped with a slight increase to range with city driving, it enhanced the experience overall. Somehow getting stopping power immediately after releasing the accelerator makes for an enhanced, increasingly predictable driving experience. You combine the immediately stopping power with extremely smooth, predictable torque and acceleration, and the car is very controlled. You can drive the car precisely. The acceleration was amazing. Merging on the highway was absolutely enthralling and invigorating. Seriously folks, they have these cars for sale for $37k if you but them in stock, and even with the negative aspects in listed above, these cars are an amazing value! * **Sound System:** The sound system is highly adaptable with EQ settings and it absolutely stunning. I have never in my life heard a sound system as beautiful as in this car. I have been in cars with custom sound systems that cost upwards of $3,500 and they did not hold a candle to this. While the system provides amazing bass, there's ""separation"" so that you never get a ""muddy"" effect and which means you somehow get a combination of amazing bass while at the same time hearing the vocals from the artist like they are singing in your ear. My God, I'm not sure how known Teslas are for their sound system, I focus on tech, autopilot, self driving, but that sound system is something special. * **Fuck With a Truck:** Yeah....so apparently there must be animosity towards Tesla drivers from Big Trucks? I thought that was a Prius thing? At least that was my experience. This huge, raised F350 with a raised kit crossed across three lanes in front of my lane and was about to ""roll coal"" when I immediately cut two lanes over and accelerated past his ass. As I looked back at him, he was looking behind him with a smile but then turned to see me ahead of him with a look of disappointment. I proceeded to decelerate behind him a couple of more times and accelerate past time while my 15 year old son gave the universal hands over the face for crying symbol followed by the universal symbol for a small penis. Yeah, I could get used to this lifestyle!  &#x200B;",2023-06-04 12:25:18,983,440,electricvehicles

"First Tesla Model 3 ‚ÄòHighland‚Äô Owners Say It‚Äôs Comfy, But Tesla Vision Is ‚ÄòRubbish'",,2023-11-03 01:23:33,605,322,teslamotors
How the Tesla Model 3 has Ruined Me,"&#x200B;  [Supercharging on the Way Home](https://preview.redd.it/uy11zpftgh831.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3947e75dfd6c0767121845235a5973ed8e72ea2e)  In November last year I took delivery of my black, rear wheel drive, long range Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôd never driven in a Tesla before, much less driven one myself. Still, the lure of a 300+ mile range fully electric vehicle and the soon to be cut in half Federal tax credit swayed me and my wife to take the plunge. Six or so months and 11,000 miles later, the car has more or less ruined me on driving any other vehicle. The Model 3 does things that feel groundbreaking and paradigm shifting, and, even more amazingly, in a, ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt it always been this way,‚Äù sort of way.  1. Entry, exit, and control of the vehicle through the app is pretty much flawless (note: with a modern phone) and doesn't require a dedicated device. Walking up to the car with your enabled smartphone means getting in is as simple as pulling on the handle. Other cars have similar behaviors with key fobs, but who wants to carry anything else around when I already have a computer with all sorts of connectivity options sitting in my pocket? This is what Tesla has done; eliminated something I used to have to carry around. The funny thing is I never really thought much about carrying keys around until I didn‚Äôt have to do so anymore. Now that I don‚Äôt have to carry keys, when I drive my wife‚Äôs car I‚Äôm very aware that I have this other device in my pocket. 2. The acceleration is effortless, silent, and addicting. Seriously addicting. I came to the Tesla from an economy sedan, so the difference for me is greater than someone who may have had another performance luxury vehicle, but oh my God is the acceleration just lovely. Even better, it‚Äôs all so effortless. When I get in another vehicle now and put the pedal down it feels like everything is just working so hard to achieve what the Tesla does instantaneously and with almost no noise (just an appealing motor whine that reminds me of the Tumbler in stealth mode in the Nolan lead Batman series). When someone in a traditionally powered vehicle drives past with their engine roaring, it feels like such an anachronism now. 3. The entire braking system does things the right way. The magnetic braking means I typically only have to use my physical brakes at somewhere between 4 and 6 MPH to come to a complete stop, instead of braking the vehicle all the way down from 60 or 65 MPH, which will clearly create far more wear on the braking system. The magnetic braking was the thing I was most nervous about initially, having read stories of people coming to jerky stops when getting used to it. Those fears were entirely unfounded. Except for my first toll booth stop (which was hilariously about 15 feet too soon), I‚Äôve found it entirely intuitive and easy to get used to. Now, when I drive a different car and take my foot off the accelerator I‚Äôm cranky about the fact that I have to push the stupid brake pedal down (what is this, the 50s?) to really slow the car, instead of the car just doing it automatically. 4. Speaking of annoying things you just do in your car without thinking about it, how about turning the car on and off? The Tesla system to turn the car on (you really don't, but you get it ready to go by pushing the brake pedal with your phone in your pocket) and turn it off (you really don‚Äôt, just open the door) doesn‚Äôt need to be a Tesla only thing. Any car with a key fob could do both of these things, really. Why do they require me to push a different button? Speaking of that, the fact that the Tesla automatically locks the doors when you get out of range takes a little getting used to (there‚Äôs initially a fear it won‚Äôt work) but once you do it‚Äôs another one of those little things that all cars should just do, but for some reason don‚Äôt. Note, however, that getting used to this stuff means you‚Äôll probably leave your other cars running accidentally. My wife has caught me just hopping out of our other car a few times without shutting it off. Sorry, I thought this was 2019. 5. The minimal gauges was something I loved from the moment I sat in the car for the first time. It took about 10 minutes to get used to looking slightly right instead of slightly down for my speed, and (admittedly) about a week to get used to the lane obstacle detection in the same location, but it‚Äôs all so clean and tidy. The internal navigation is fantastic (and the 3D perspective it gives is a nice touch), and the infotainment system works well (generally). I was initially worried I‚Äôd hate not having SiriusXM (and honestly, I still think for this level of car it should be an option), but I ended up cancelling my app-based Sirius subscription about 2 months after getting the car because there are a ton of options built in for free. Getting into a more typical car now feels like information overload, with dozens of dials, gauges, and buttons competing for my attention, and LED light coming from every direction. Driving the Model 3, in particular at night, feels far more connected with the outside world because of the minimal distractions within the cabin. 6. What does gas cost right now? I honestly don‚Äôt know, but up until November I‚Äôd always had a sense of what it cost per gallon, because I was filling up every 6 days. Even better, my wife barely has to fill up more than once a month because on the weekends we pile all five of us into my car for basically every drive (us plus our three daughters). Our other vehicle (a Pacifica) is relegated to times where we both need to go somewhere or we‚Äôre driving a long enough distance that having three kids in the back is going to lead to arguments. Otherwise, even though the kids clearly have significantly more space in the minivan, they always want to drive in the Tesla. This gets me to another reason this car has ruined me on other cars. Sure, I need to charge, but I just plug in when I get home, and I head in to the house. No more freezing while pumping gas in the middle of February. Sure, I lost approximately 25% range in the Winter months due to the cold, but that‚Äôs not much of a problem when you can ‚Äúfill up‚Äù every night (scheduled to use off-peak electric prices) if you‚Äôre worried about your range, and the car is filling up while I‚Äôm reading, hanging out with the wife and kids, or sleeping. 7. How about service? I had a minor squeaking coming from the back wheels when reversing (common problem) and my horn would only sound when I pushed the right hand side (again, common). I scheduled service within the app for the nearest location, and then Tesla sent a message a few days later saying that these issues could be addressed by their mobile service system, so they drove to my house and did everything in my driveway. I didn‚Äôt need to go to some shop, sit in their waiting room for who knows how long, try to work using their wifi, etc. I just hung out at my house, doing what I usually would, and they fixed the two issues. Awesome. 8. Software updates are flawless and fast. You get notified on your phone that an update is available, click to start the update process, and then a little later get notified that the update is complete. By comparison, software updates in our Pacifica created a situation where climate control was broken for a month while they figured out what went wrong, and updating my old car required me to download images to a flash drive and sit with the car running for an hour while the update was applied. Updates are also super frequent and not insignificant in what they‚Äôre doing, including things like adding 5% more range to the car and better power (as if that was really necessary).  To be objective, however, there are some annoyances:  1. Voice control is still pretty limited. My 2012 Ford had better voice control options (voice and phrase detection was far worse in that car, which is pretty much flawless in the Tesla, but there were more phrases it would recognize), including some that I think are absolutely necessary, like, ‚ÄúCall Sarah on mobile.‚Äù Right now in the Tesla I can only say, ‚ÄúCall Sarah,‚Äù and it lists all the numbers I have for her in my contacts, which requires me to scroll to find the right one and tap on it on the display. 2. Speaking of phone control, the pick up / hang up options should be able to be ‚Äútapped‚Äù through the steering wheel buttons. 3. Cell connectivity sometimes just flakes out for the in-car infotainment. I park underground at work, so the car won‚Äôt have LTE coverage in the garage, but it also seems to just lose the ability to reconnect when I come back up above ground (probably weekly). A couple of times a month it seems to require a soft reboot to get it to reconnect to LTE. 4. The piano black plastic covers for the center console area are scratch and dust magnets. I tried to wrap them but messed it up the first time so I haven‚Äôt tried again. Still, for an expensive car I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a nicer setup in such a prominent area. It‚Äôs pretty clear this is a common complaint when center console wraps are such a common purchase for Model 3 owners.  Two other points worth mentioning quickly:  1. This car is more contagious than a yawn at the DMV. A friend and my parents both bought Model 3s after driving in mine basically once. It‚Äôs that nice. It‚Äôs that different. 2. I recently got back from a 3.5 hour drive in our other car (family vacation), and I immediately volunteered to go get groceries, just so I could drive the Tesla. Usually the last thing I‚Äôd want to do is drive more after a long drive. Instead, it just highlighted the advantages of the Tesla.  So, that‚Äôs it at a high level. The Model 3 has ruined me on other cars, and it has done so by concentrating on the everyday aspects of car driving. In the Kano model, it has basically added delighters and performance features that everyone else is just checking the box on. It takes a lot of things we just take for granted as ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs done,‚Äù and reimagined them in a way that feels like it‚Äôs redefining what driving should be in the 21st century.  &#x200B;  PS. If this belongs in the TeslaLounge I apologize.",2019-07-05 13:02:48,2728,428,teslamotors

Tesla Model 3 for $20K? New norm?,"Currently in the market for a new car and decided to take a peek at Tesla after renting one.  I was expecting $27k-$33k range, but was shocked to see many priced closer to $20k-$23k. Miles ranged from 30k to 90k, varying years. Mostly standard ranges but a few long ranges with higher mileage.  Is this the new market? Am I missing something? I saw quite a few for $20k with under 50k miles - I didn't realize how affordable the car was if these are normal prices. Are there major repairs I should be wary of?   I'm in the northeast of the U.S. if that makes a difference.",2024-03-05 22:55:11,112,309,askcarguys

Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla‚Äôs Model 3, as price wars heat up in China‚Äôs fiercely competitive electric car market.  Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country ‚Äî a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.  Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.  Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3‚Ä≤s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.  Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi‚Äôs car factory, for which all ‚Äúkey‚Äù steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.  Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan ‚Äúunder 500,000 yuan‚Äù ($69,328).  The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.  Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.  BYD‚Äôs Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.  Nio‚Äôs ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng‚Äôs P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr‚Äôs 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.  Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.  Accessories  The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.  Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.  The SU7 supports Apple‚Äôs Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.  Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúFull Self Driving‚Äù for city streets has yet to be released in the country.  Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the ‚ÄúMax‚Äù version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche‚Äôs Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.  Ecosystem of devices  The SU7 is part of Xiaomi‚Äôs recently launched ‚ÄúHuman x Car x Home‚Äù strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company‚Äôs revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.  Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 ‚Äî and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.  Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.  The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle‚Äôs exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

I'm getting rid of my 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range after 6 months of ownership. Here's why:,"I decided to lease a Tesla Model 3 Long Range (through my company) in June of 2021. After 6 months, I've decided that I absolutely hate the car. Here's why:  * Autopilot isn't nearly as good as I expected. It works well under one condition: you are on the freeway on a clearly marked lane with no lanes splitting or merging into your lane. The Tesla has SLAMMED on the brakes while going 70MPH on the freeway because the carpool lane split into two lanes and the Tesla didn't know how to navigate it. Also it will brake if someone inches toward your lane and grazes the lane marker, even if they don't merge. It also won't see people obviously merging into your lane, and will brake late once the car is fully in the lane. If you attempt to change lanes to pass someone, adaptive cruise control will start braking as you are diagonally passing the car because it thinks you're going to hit the car (even if you're 3+ car lengths back) and attempting to pass. The system is overly cautious and is way worse than I expected.  * Using the screen to control everything is mind-bogglingly frustrating. Everything is *juust* out of reach while your back is against the seat, and the screen can't pivot towards you. So you not only have to take your eyes off the road for way too long to find anything you also have to reach to tap it. And since the icons/buttons are relatively small, if you're driving while trying to tap something, small bumps in the road will make it nearly impossible to tap the correct selection on the first try. You have to stabilize your hand on the edge of the screen. Contrasting with Apple Car Play, which has big, widely separated icons that are easy to tap/navigate, this is just bad.  * The Siri-like voice-activated controller is terrible. Especially when trying to call people, even someone on my favorites or someone I've called a million times. E.g. ""Call Joe Shmoe"" ""...calling Shannon Example."" Again, now I have to take my eyes off the road for way to long to navigate, find, and call someone. Same problem happens with speech to text for texting someone. This is especially a problem for me because my friends/family have non-typical/American names. Siri can recognize the names, but the Tesla can't.  * Navigation is not great. Everything is a shade of white/grey/black. So since everything is on the same screen, it's hard to see where your next turn/direction is. Contrasting with Google Maps, where the next step/direction is outlined in a dark green (high contrast) box that makes it super easy to identify. Then, if you try to change your music, the location of the directions section on the screen also changes. And for some reason, the audio settings for the navigation almost always gets set to mute every time I drive, so I always have to manually adjust it back so I can hear where I need to go. (I made sure it was set to the correct volume in the menu, and it still goes to mute)  * The audio doesn't/can't always connect to Spotify or my phone, so sometimes I have to drive in silence. Happens about 25% of the time, but has gotten much better in recent months.  * Regenerative braking is applied when lifting off the throttle. You cannot coast. I knew this when getting the car and thought I would get used to it, which for the most part I did, but it really makes driving a lot more taxing. You always have to be in perfect control of the throttle if you want to just coast, otherwise you're either accelerating or decelerating.  * There are no blind-spot monitors. Every car I know of has blind spot monitors. This doesn't even so much as chime when you turn your blinker on while another car is in your blind spot. They used to highlight a surrounding car in red (on the center screen) if your blinker is on and they're in your blind-spot, now they have the side camera activate when you turn on your blinker. But who checks the center screen when trying to change lanes to the left or right? That's bad design. Also, the car has slightly smaller-than-average side mirrors. Note: I have my mirrors adjusted correctly to see my blind-spots clearly. I still like have blind-spot monitors (just in case).   * The AC/Heat controls are not great. Again, requiring too much attention off the road to control. Also, you can't turn off the driver's side vents and only have the passenger's open. And the opposite is true as well: you can't turn off the passenger's vent's and have the driver's open.   * The smartphone proximity enabled door-unlocking works, but sometimes there is a small delay of about 3 seconds. Happens at the most inconvenient times, it seems. I have to pull out my phone, check and see that my bluetooth is enabled and the app is open on my phone, then I try the door again and by that time it has recognized my phone and it's proximity, and it works. To clarify, in the above anecdote bluetooth is on and the app is open the whole time.  * The rear camera is sometimes choppy/laggy when reversing.  * When using autopilot on the freeway/highway at night, the high beams will come on unless there is a car within about ~500 feet in front of you, in which case it will use low beams. Using your brights on the freeway with other cars around (within about a quarter mile, I'd say) can create glare/distraction and is generally unsafe, both for cars on your side of the freeway and for motorists on the other side. So when the brights come on, I have to take it out of autopilot and steer manually until it notices more cars around. (Note: you cannot use autopilot at night without headlights set to automatic high beam.)  **TL;DR:** Ultimately, the main reason I'm getting rid of the car is because of the screen. It's a huge gimmick. It's difficult to use/navigate, and requires too much attention off the road to get anything done. This is the right car for some people, but isn't the right car for me. I'm going to miss the great, instant acceleration/torque. But I want something with regular knobs/buttons and apple car play.  **EDIT 1:** The cars I'm considering next are either a CT4-V (non-Blackwing) with SuperCruise, or a Genesis G70.  **EDIT 2:** THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT AND I COMPLETELY FORGOT. Tesla no longer allows you to purchase OR sell your car at the end of your lease. They force you to return the car to them. This means that when the lease was over, I wouldn't be able to sell the car to CarMax to make money on the car. I think this is super unethical because I see a lease as me ~~purchasing~~ renting a car with an agreement that the car company *can* take the car back at the end of the lease (emphasis on ""can""). The ~~purchaser~~ customer should have the right to do what they want with the car, whether that means buy it out or sell it to a third party. This is specifically a problem because when I ~~bought~~ leased the car I specifically asked, ""will I be able to sell the car to a third party dealership?"" and the answer was ""yes."" Three months after I had the car, they changed that rule all of a sudden and now forced to give your car back (or transfer the lease, which is what I'm doing). When leasing a car, the increased equity (due to the car shortage) belongs to the ~~BUYER~~ customer, not the manufacturer. Apparently more and more automakers are doing this, which I think is entirely messed up.  **EDIT 3:** I want to clarify something: I'm not frustrated that I couldn't buy the car- that part was always clear. I'm frustrated that I couldn't *sell* the car.   In the contract it specifically says that you cannot buy the car at the end of the lease. However, it didn't specifically exclude third-party dealership buyouts. I also asked the salesman and Tesla financial *before* getting the lease if they would allow a buyout from a third-party dealership, and they both said ""yes.""  The issue is that it seems unethical to change the terms of an agreement after the agreement was made. (This was not specifically stated in the contract, that it would allow third-party dealership buyouts. But it also wasn't specifically prohibited. There was also a section in Tesla's online account that allowed you to ""Sell Car to Dealer"" and request a buyout amount.)  When Tesla did that, I felt like they were taking something that, in my mind, I felt was mine:   1. The freedom to get out of the lease how and when I wanted to. 2. The money that would have been mine if I sold to a dealership. (Specifically, market value minus the sum of the residual value plus the remaining lease payments)  From a strictly financial perspective, I understand that it was not a purchase, and that I never had equity. Those were the wrong words to use. My main point was that I had a certain idea of how leases work, and what my lease-end options would be. Ultimately, those options were limited to my disadvantage, and I felt frustrated about that.",2022-01-26 20:44:36,3532,1094,cars

My Tesla Model 3 Highland Test Drive Experience + Comparison to Legacy Model 3,"I recently had the chance to test drive a Model 3 Highland. I wanted to do a brief write-up here about my experience with it and how it compares to our OG 2018 Model 3 LR RWD.  First of all, let's get the main drawback out of the way: the exclusion of stalks; the steering turn signals are just annoying, straight up, especially when maneuvering; if the steering wheel is upside down, the buttons control the opposite side than they indicate; and the turn signals only turned on about 80% of the time I hit the button; the touch target was too small; it just adds an extra level of thought into the process of using your turn signals that is unneeded. I didn't hate the touch-screen swipe to shift as much as I thought I would; it was relatively easy to get used to for me, but that doesn't mean I like it. I still much prefer the column-mounted shifter in our 3. It's quicker and easier. The whole touch-screen scenario still strongly feels like a solution to a problem to an issue that did not exist, along with the turn signals.  Besides that, the driving experience was better in almost every way than our 2018 Model 3, the steering felt better, had more communication and overall felt better. The NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) is leaps and bounds better than our 3 (although still not as good as our ID.4), to be fair, I've never driven a Model 3 that was made in-between our 2018 Model 3 and this 2024 Model 3 Highland, so the Highland is probably less of the giant leap of improvement from our 2018 model if you're coming from, say a newer pre-Highland Model 3 with the improved suspension, our 2018 model has absolutely awful NVH, so basically anything is an improvement, but the Highland is a *significant* improvement, its quite good. The only thing that was worse than our Model 3 is that there was a whine from the motors while accelerating, louder than any motor whine I've heard in any EV I've been in, it may have just been a problem with the specific unit I was driving though.  The interior and build quality are also improved; the interior materials are nice, but still not on the level of a BMW or an Audi imo. There are some nice improvements in the Highland, however; for example, the door pockets are now lined with felt, and the cheap-feeling fake wood is now replaced with a nice fabric insert. The seats are also more comfortable to me. The build quality in the unit I drove was good, *for a Tesla*. It still had some panels that were slightly misaligned and a little rattle that would come in and out, but overall, it was better built than the majority of the Teslas I've been in. The stereo was also quite good, and the Premium Audio in the Highland 3 was a decent amount better than the Premium Audio system in our 3, which is impressive because the system in our 3 is quite good. The cooled seats weren't that good; I could barely tell they were on even at the highest setting.  Overall, I think it's a good upgrade, at least compared to our aging 2018 Model 3. However, the deletion of the stalks holds it back in an unnecessary way, but even considering that, it's a better car.

Tesla Model 3 Postmortem (5 years of ownership),"The other guy's Model Y postmortem ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzct79/tesla\_model\_y\_postmortem\_2\_years\_of\_ownership/](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzct79/tesla_model_y_postmortem_2_years_of_ownership/) ) sounded fun so I'm copying his template.  &#x200B;  After almost five years (Jan 2018, serial number under 5000), I sold my 2018 Model 3 LR RWD last weekend.   I was a Musk/Tesla cheerleader when I got it and I have become‚Ä¶ something else‚Ä¶ in the meantime. I'll attempt to keep this on the topic of my actual vehicle experience for the most part.  &#x200B;  # The Good  * **Performance** \- It's zippy in a straight line until you get to extralegal speeds, and stays reasonably well composed in the corners when driving aggressively. * **One pedal driving** \- Like the other guy, I REALLY liked this.  I will miss it and am not looking forward to having to use my brake pedal more. * **Mobile app** \- Worked well for the most part (exceptions to be mentioned elsewhere). * **Autopilot (Just Autosteer, TACC, and driver-initiated automatic lane changes. The rest to be discussed elsewhere)**\- This was the reason I bought the car and for the first couple of years, it steadily improved.   I still have no regrets buying the car + autopilot (basic autopilot wasn't included back then, it cost me an extra $5k). * **Sound system** \- I'm no audiophile but pretty good to me. * **Nav/charging integration** \- This made switching to an EV pretty simple, the car would generally figure out where I'd need to stop and charge, and it got better at it over time. * **Overall reliability** \- Not the best I've had on a new car, but far from the worst.   Never left me stranded, never had a major feature stop working. * **Frunk -** What a great, great place to keep things you need to have with you, but don't need to access every day. * **TPMS -** It's difficult to express how pleased I was and am with how good the implementation of that is.   Made it a dream to manage multiple sets of wheels. * **The general EV experience** \- I didn't really want an electric car, I just wanted Autopilot (there was no serious competition to it at the time).   I did not expect it to be this great, and I'll never switch back. Charging at home is life.   Edited to add:  Camp mode! Super useful!    # The Bad and Ugly (I'm combining them because how much they pissed me off varied based on the day, and they're not in any particular order).  * **The seats.**  I know a lot of y'all like them, that's fine. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I \*hated\* them.   The high floor caused by the battery pack, coupled with the lack of adjustable thigh support, compounded by the poor range of adjustability on the squab tilt, made the car quite uncomfortable on long drives for me. * **Cabin noise (wind and road)** \- Jesus Christ.  This car was $59,000 and has the sound isolation of a 1998 Civic‚Ä¶ and no, it is NOT because there's no engine to cover up the noise. * **Lack of CarPlay** \- I know a bunch of you use Spotify or whatever. That's fine, I'm not saying you should have to use CarPlay when you have a native app to use.  But I'm an Apple Music, [Audible.com](https://Audible.com), and podcast guy, and using bluetooth to stream from my phone is some shit from days we should have left behind by now, and it's an awful experience. * **Lack of binnacle/HUD -** Obviously I knew what I was getting into here and it's MOSTLY ok.  General day to day shit is fine, but here's where it falls apart:  When using nav.  Because I'm an audiobooks guy mostly, I \*HATE\* voice guidance interrupting what I'm listening to, and because of the UI design for the nav, I'd miss cues on the center stack sometimes and miss turns. * **Interface / changes** \- The car's interface got progressively worse over a half decade, and less usable and less safe as functions were moved behind multiple layers of menus, which brings us to‚Ä¶ * **Lack of actual buttons for climate control, lights, and wipers adjustments -** Voice controls are not a panacea for this. * **Torque sensor to determine driver engagement when using auto steer -** Ok, for the S/X I get it, they had to solve this problem with what they had.   There's no excuse for the 3, Y, and refreshed S/X not to have touch sensors around the rim of the wheel to determine hand presence. * **Special mention for how the climate zone sync works (or rather, doesn't) -** What sort of stupid asshole thought this up?  seriously.   Under what circumstances does it make sense for a passenger adjusting their side of the car to not disable the sync, and instead adjust the driver's side too, forcing the driver to have to fumble around to bring up the menu to disable the sync, and then adjust their temp back where it goes. * **Additional special mention for lack of buttons for rear passengers to adjust their own seat heaters -** I've got more important shit to do than manage your ass cheek comfort, rear seat scum. * **Door handles, and vent controls -**  They're not intuitive to most people and I got tired of having to give briefings. * **The rest of enhanced autopilot** \- Autopark is slower than waiting for my partner to decide what they want for dinner. That's REAL fucking slow.    Smart summon has been broken for MONTHS and cannot be initiated.     Nav on Autopilot?  Actually not bad‚Ä¶ if you are the only car on the road.  It tries to get over wayyyyyyyyy too soon.  Like, 5 miles early to change 3 lanes and sit behind some 18 wheeler doing 17 under in traffic when the #2 lane was still moving plenty fast. * **FSD** \- It's *a fucking scam.*  It will never, ever deliver what we paid for:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/oey4g1/for\_those\_who\_never\_know\_and\_those\_who\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/oey4g1/for_those_who_never_know_and_those_who_have/).   Yes, I paid for it. Yes, I had the beta for a long time.  No, I did not think it was worth it and it made me LOSE the remaining faith I had left. * **Phone as key -** In theory? Great. In practice, really  aggravatingly high failure rate.   I'm not saying every time, or even every day, but having to take my phone out of my pocket and unlock via the app even once a week is far, far too frequent * **Lack of a ski passthrough on the rear seats -** Folding down a full seat seems wasteful and dramatically increases the already terrible road noise. * **Why oh why is the front T logo not also a button to open the frunk?**  Having to use the app or the screen makes this a way less useful storage space * **Piano black interior trim -** If you've ever been responsible for the decision to put this in a vehicle without offering an alternative, I hope you end up with actual OCD, because you fucking deserve it. Asshole. * **No interior monitor or glass breakage sensor for the alarm** \- Coupled with the lack of locks on the rear seats, Teslas became prime targets for break-ins. It didn't have to be this way. * **Red rear turn signals** \- These are less safe. They've been known to be less safe for a long, long fucking time. STOP USING THEM, SHITHEADS. * **Door armrest is too low** \- Self explanatory * **The community** \- You can be a fan of a product while acknowledging problems with the product, the company, or the company's leadership.   The cultist types (and I acknowledge that I have become the anti-cultist / hater) are a net negative for the company in the long term.  Edited to add: the minimalist interior. I thought I'd like it, turns out I don't.   I do not for even one moment regret buying the car‚Ä¶ but I do regret buying FSD.

"Renting a Tesla Model 3, read this","Had a chance to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz. Here is how I felt it compared to the EV6 GT-Line I own and what I recommend when renting.   * Hertz only gives you a keycard and no access to the app. * Take a few min to set the car up before you exit. I needed a min to just find the odometer to tell the guy at the exit window and felt stupid. * Feels a little strange not turning off the car when you exit at first but you will get used to it. Hate that you have to use the keycard each time to drive. Wish they gave you a proper key you can just have in your pocket. * Set the mirrors and AC vents before driving as it is just not easy to do on screen when driving 70 on the highway. * Make sure the hotel you stay has destination charging if you are driving long. Not needed just peace of mind and saves time at the supercharger. * The model 3 was surprisingly more spacious than I thought. * Hated the rain wiper algorithm that Tesla uses and constantly had to fiddle with it. * Missed the 360 camera and the automatic camera display when the parking sensor is triggered. * The car felt stable even on a heavy rainy day but ride comfort was not that great. * Missed the HUD. The speed display is just too small on the side screen. * Wish it had bigger text and display icons similar to Apple CarPlay. Tesla navigation is soo good, I did not miss having Apple CarPlay. * The stalks for the turn signals are harder than a regular car. * Overall if you own a ICE car or a EV take the chance and drive it, both the car and the software are way better. Don‚Äôt think a test drive captures the renting experience and I wonder ownership will only be better than this.",2023-05-13 12:45:01,293,312,electricvehicles

Yesterday Tesla repossessed my model 3‚Ä¶ and now they are admitting their mistake,"I wake up to my model 3 being hooked up to a tow truck. I ask them whats going on and apparently I missed my payments. I explain that my payments are set to auto and I just saw the tesla payment go out a couple weeks before. They say they have their instructions and theres nothing they can do now. Show me the letter mandating repossession and go on their way.       I sit on hold with tesla for an hour. I have all documents and emails showing that the payment was made full at the time of signing. That my monthly payment is automated. Puts me on hold to review everything then apologizes for their mistake.       Turns out theres a missing $3000 payment on their end?? My guess is they didnt apply part of the rebate the car qualified for, leading to all this. I got no warning phone calls, no voicemails, nothing in the tesla app.       The car is under my business name. Without a car I cannot work. To deal with this I end up cancelling my clients for the day leading to a $1000+ loss. As well as straining my relationship with my clients.       What course of action can I take against tesla?   -I was going to post this in the other tesla subs but I figure it will just get removed       Update:     I see alot of people speculating why I didn‚Äôt just rent a car since my day was worth 1000+. This thought did cross my mind but with the nature of my work this was  not worth it. My business is mobile healthcare. I work 1 on 1 with patients and if a call comes in while Im with a patient I cannot answer it. The time between patients I handle billing and appointment setting. What I did not want was this to effect the subsequent days as I work weekend all worth the same amount. I made the decision to cancel my day to handle this and Im glad I did versus renting a car. During the day after many back and forth calls between tesla, the tow company and myself, gathering and sending proof they agreed to drop the car back off instead of me going to go pick it up. 6pm same day it was brought back to me. Plus the bill I was given was totalling 5k, so it made more sense for me to figure this out. In the end I will pay nothing, they have reversed all requested payments, they handled the tow from my home and back to my home. They were very apologetic I‚Äôm just extremely frustrated by this and felt I should post this so other people are aware. Looking online it seems Im not the only one this has happened to.   Update2:     Also people saying take an uber. I drive from patient to patients home with equipment. Its not just driving to a workplace and spending my day there.

Tesla model 3 LR vs standard,"Hello,  So I am going to buy the 2024 tesla model 3, however I am really stuck on which variant to choose (long range or standard). The long range seems like the best option but the battery cannot be charged to 100% on a daily basis and doing the math on the est range vs standard. It only works out to be roughly 35 miles extra when taking into account a 90% max charge. Also the speed is about 1.6 sec faster am not really a car person but I do like fast cars lol. If I buy the standard version would i really be missing out on a whole experience (the 7k price increase for those small changes seems kinda crazy).",2024-01-11 12:01:02,53,180,TeslaModel3

Tesla Model 3 monthly insurance MORE than Car payment in BC !?,"Hey guys and girls of beautiful British Columbia,   I have been thinking of getting a new car. As part of that process I thought it'd be wise to compare insurance prices for all of my options. And good thing I did because while every other car I have been eying I was quoted under 350 to insure (Comprehensive with a 500 deductible) for a new Tesla Model 3 apparently I gotta pay 685 dollars a month to insure it!  I have no claims, 5 year driving history, no points. I know from an insurance point of view I am a new driver, and as such I don't mind paying the 350\~ insurance premium but almost SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS?   Is there a reason for that? I know it can't be just cause its an electric as as new Bolt EUV is 310 to insure. So what is up here? I see Teslas EVERYWHERE in BC; is this what everyone is paying? Is everyone only using basic (no collision/third party only) insurance? (I was quoted 124 for this one) or what?  Are there any options I have to lower this cost? I was thinking basic + Optiom but I am all ears to any ideas or explanations.   Thanks!",2024-05-01 22:51:32,97,258,britishcolumbia

Might be regretting new Nissan leaf,"So I am definitely not a car person. I bought a new 2024 Nissan leaf sv plus and I have loved it so far. I have a small daily commute and it's really good for that.  However, the other day I went on a trip that wasn't that far you'd think, and realized the battery drained much faster than I thought. Especially because it's cold. Then I realized that there's only one chademo fast charger in my whole province...this is something I should have known before buying the car but I was dumb and didn't know not all chargers were the same.  Now it feels like I won't be able to do any road trips at all due to the charging situation. We're a one car household as well. Would it be terrible to sell it or should I just deal with it?",2024-01-14 04:21:17,156,195,electricvehicles
Used Nissan Leafs... Am I mad? ,"People always talk about the used car market gone mad, am I nuts for thinking a 2018/2019 leaf with 50-90k km for about 10-12k is OK value?

Currently spending 50e a week in petrol, probably about 55 with repairs on 2009 1.2 litre.   Would pay cash, no finance. Range would be about 180-220km.   Talk me in or out of these cars, please.

Help! Just bought a used Nissan Leaf,I just bought a 2018 Nissan Leaf from Carvana and it's still in the 7 day money back window. When it arrived it had a full charge with the range saying 140 miles. I drove it over the weekend and got it down to about 20%. I charged it in my garage in a regular outlet with nothing else on the circuit for 24 hours and got it to 100%. But the range said only 115 miles at 100%! Did I do something wrong? That's a huge descrepency and if the car only has a range of 115 then I paid too much and might consider returning it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. This is my first EV and I'm completely ignorant to all of it,2023-10-24 16:01:49,6,84,leaf

Bought a used 2016 nissan leaf and detest it,"It had 40k mils with 11 bars in the 23kwh battery. It was for $12.5k. After fully charging it, the mileage drops from 83 to 70 within 2 miles. Then it keeps on dropping and eventually travels for 40-50 miles per charge.   I took it to the Nissan service and they said ALL the checks are green and it has no warranty on the battery even though the 8 years haven‚Äôt passed yet not the 100k miles.  They sold it to me with a doc that says range is 114 but in the small font it says 84miles.  Now I‚Äôm regretting buying this piece of junk. The agent in the dealership lied to me saying it‚Äôs range is 114 and it is still under warranty. Turns out it‚Äôs not and they won‚Äôt replace it. they assured me it was 114 miles range. I didn‚Äôt do my thorough homework before buying it and feel bad.  What did I do wrong and how can I fix it. Can I change it with a 30kwh battery?

Nissan Leaf or E-golf?,So a few weeks ago I asked a question about getting an EV in the countryside.  &#x200B;  I decided I want to go for it but now it is more about which one.  The use of the car would be going to work (37 miles or 74 round commute) or the gym (35 min / 21 miles). The time of the commute can vary from 1 hour to 2.5 h and I'm saying this because I'm not sure if the time stuck in traffic could affect hugely or not the battery life.  I see the leaf is more horsepower and acceleration than the E-golf which attracts me but the E-golf is better looking.  Price wise I see that both are more or less the same.  I'm looking into second hand cars from around 2019/2020  &#x200B;  My question:   would the e-golf be powerful enough? my concern is the overtaking.   Would the e-golf suit my needs or should I look for another car?,2023-10-16 11:30:30,2,12,CarTalkUK

Would you buy a used Nissan Leaf?,"We have a Kia Niro EV as our primary car, we are looking for a second car for our family, as my husband starts a new job in a few weeks. We both have been WFH for the last year, and he worked 5 blocks from home before that. His commute is still small, about 5 miles. But it has reached the point where being a one car family probably isn't going to work.  So we are definitely looking for something far less expensive than our Niro, but I really don't want to buy a ICE, for this short commute.  We do qualify for the full tax rebate on a new leaf, but would probably need to get the base model to fit our budget. I have about 12,000 in cash, from my recently totaled ICE.   I feel like this is the worst time to buy a car, new or used, especially after we just got one in December... But ces't la vie.  So what would you do?",2022-06-09 16:29:33,17,69,electricvehicles

Nissan leaf question,"Could people who own Nissan leafs let me know how many KMs the car says it can do after a full charge? Don't care about your battery state of health, just trying to confirm a suspicion that my dealer might not have been honest when they sold to me a year ago.  My number of KMs it says it can do has hardly changed, but the state of health has dropped massively since purchase, and if the KMs work the way I think they do, I think they sold me something with a much worse state of health that they said. But maybe I just misunderstood how the KMs the car says it can do are measured.  edit:   Thanks everyone. Sounds like either the car sat around at some point before being sold and degraded during that time, or was incorrectly advertised. I should the have the original SoH in a day or two .

Nissan Unable/unwilling to honor warranty of 2021 Nissan Leaf ,"Hi everyone I want to document my experience with Nissan after my 2021 Nissan Leaf SV Plus High Voltage battery failed. Mileage on the vehicle is approx. 47,650 miles (this is important later)  First the details:  The afternoon of 22JAN2024 my Nissan Leaf would not start and showed that there was a electrical system fault. I had driven it just fine that morning. The vehicle also would not charge. I called the dealership and they had me have Nissan Roadside tow the vehicle to their service center. (side note the Nissan contracted towing agency could not figure out how to get the vehicle in neutral and had no experience with Leafs at all)  The Dealership quickly determined that the high voltage battery was defective and that it needed to be replaced. The battery should be replaced under the 8yr 100,000 mile warranty. They moved quickly to get the warranty repair approved. (I have no fault with the dealership)  This is where it gets sticky. The dealership initially said that the repair would only take a couple days as soon as the part was delivered and they expected that since it was a newer car that a replacement battery would be on the next truck. This was not the case. What I have come to learn is that the High Voltage battery is treated differently from every other part Nissan has. The dealership is unable to obtain a status on delivery of a HV battery or track it or obtain any information on when it will be delivered. For several weeks I waited calling back frequently until their management found me a loaner vehicle (the dealership does not have a large fleet and given what I have learned about the Leafs I understand why most are in use by leaf owners) and they told me that they continue to have no success with Nissan on getting information about the battery and gave me the Nissan Corporate number to call to put in a complaint because they have found that customers have more success.  I called the corporate number and provided the details of the situation. They started a case and for several weeks I received bi-weekly calls from Nissan corporate telling me that they had no information but were following up and forwarding to this specialist or that.  On 05APR2024 I received a call from an Arbitration Specialist saying that they would be taking over my case and that Nissan has no idea when it will be able to replace the battery in my Leaf. It could be weeks, months, or years. The battery can not currently be manufactured because of supply chain and manufacturing issues. They continued to inform me that Nissan would like to offer a voluntary buyback of my vehicle under the guidelines of the North Carolina's Lemon Law. They asked me to provide several documents at which point they would provide a written offer to me that I could agree to or not. Here is the contents of the original email and attached document.  ""Good Morning,  ¬†  Thank you for speaking with me. Please review the attached Intent Letter and provide all requested information to move forward. I‚Äôve included a brief description of the repurchase option you‚Äôre provided with.  ¬†  Repurchase: Once I obtain the requested documents, I will review to see if you are due a refund and let you know what that refund would be. I will add up all payments you have made so far which include the monthly vehicle payments, down payment, or trade in. From that amount there will be certain deductions which will include: the mileage fee, any 3rd party warranties, accessories, GAP and any negative equity. Please keep in mind if you are in a cash negative situation you could owe Nissan money for a repurchase. This option can take up to 4 to 6 weeks and is dependent on how long it takes to receive documents and process paperwork. If you added any accessories or if there is any damage to the vehicle, it will need to be put back to factory specification before surrendering it for a repurchase  ¬†  Please contact me directly if you have any questions.""  ""We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to contact Nissan regarding your situation. As a company  interested in winning lifelong customers, Nissan apologizes for any inconvenience you may have  experienced.  Nissan carefully considered your request during a review of all available facts pertaining to your  situation. Based on the vehicle repair history, Nissan offers to voluntarily repurchase this vehicle.  In order to coordinate the repurchase of your vehicle, Nissan needs to know the particular facts  pertaining to your ownership and intentions regarding the vehicle. Please complete and return the  following documents to me at your convenience, as they will be needed to make a detailed offer:  ‚Ä¢ A legible copy of the vehicle‚Äôs current registration  ‚Ä¢ A copy of the vehicle‚Äôs title application  ‚Ä¢ A copy of the original purchase agreement  ‚Ä¢ A copy of the lienholder information release (enclosed)  ‚Ä¢ A copy of the payment history of the lien  ‚Ä¢ A 10-day payoff from your lienholder  ‚Ä¢ Pictures of all 4 sides of the vehicle and the interior  Please return the requested information to me via email or fax at (615) 984-5125. We anticipate  completing the repurchase within 2 to 4 weeks from the time of your acceptance. Please note:  supplying the requested documents does not indicate your acceptance of the offer; you will have a  chance to review the fully detailed offer before making a decision.""  I provided the arbitrator the documents and waited 2 weeks. (Note, they apparently have a rotation for arbitration cases, so if you receive something from them on Friday they will not contact you again until the next Friday no matter how many times you message or call)  Today I received the following offer from them which I am not satisfied with. This meets the bare minimum of the lemon law in North Carolina and does not honor my purchase or the minimum warranty requirements set out by the federal government for the warranty of 8 years and/or 100,000 miles.  Here is the offer they provided me:  ""Thank you for allowing Nissan the opportunity to review this matter. Based on the repair history of  your vehicle, Nissan would like to voluntarily repurchase the above referenced vehicle under the terms  of the North Carolina Lemon Law.  Based on the information above and the documents we have received, the refund calculations are as  follows:  Base Price: $43,095.00  Sales Tax: $1,013.79  License-35: $35.00  Government Certificate of Title Fees: $52.00  DOC Fee: $698.00  Total Purchase Price: $44,893.79  Less Usage: $17,029.45  Less Rebates: $6,000.00  Total Deductions: $23,029.45  Lien Payoff: $21,864.34  Amount Payable to Customer: $0  We anticipate completing the repurchase within 2 to 4 weeks from the time of your acceptance. An  agent from Morley VSPC, our third-party vendor, will contact you to schedule the vehicle surrender.""  Note the usage is calculated by the following formula: Sales Price - ((mileage / 120000) \* Sales Price) This means that if you have driven 120,000 miles your vehicle is worthless.  I replied back with the following email, they then called me back answered a few questions and indicated that they will review the documentation I provided and see if they could include any of that in the buyback offer. During the call I informed them that I knew that better offers were made to individuals in other states. They informed me that they had to go by the rules in my state. I informed them that this was the minimum they could do not the maximum. I will let you all know how this proceeds.  my reply:  ""Hi Cxxxx,  ¬†  I will not be signing this agreement in the manner in which it is now.¬† Please assist me in understanding and addressing a several items.  1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Base price listed on the repurchase agreement does not match any of the information present on the original purchase agreement I signed and provided to you.¬† Where did this number come from?¬† Please see the attached original purchase agreement.  2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The repurchase agreement does not appear to take into account the value of my trade in at the time.  3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Please indicate the exact calculation used to determine the ‚Äúless usage‚Äù amount.¬†  4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why is there no additional item to reimbursement me for the current 13 weeks of loss to the use of my vehicle which is due to a warranty protected part?¬† This is a relatively new vehicle and Nissan has failed to meet its warranty obligations.¬†¬† At this point my loss of usage amounts to 8060 commuting miles driving another vehicle.¬† At the federal milage rate of $.67 per mile that amounts to $5400.20.  5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I have additional costs related to this vehicle including the installation of a 40 amp circuit in my home for level 2 charging of this vehicle.¬† This required the installation of a new electrical meter with a total cost of $9,491.19.¬† Please see the attached invoice.  6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This offer does not remedy my need for a dependable vehicle which is what I thought I was buying.¬† It does not fix my vehicle.¬† It does not replace my vehicle.¬† It does not allow me to replace my vehicle.¬† I expected that Nissan would honor its warranty commitments.¬†¬†  ¬†  I hope that Nissan will review this information and work to provide me with a better solution to their warranty defect.¬† I would accept a fair buyback offer but I do not believe that this offer is fair.¬† Nissan is doing the absolute bare minimum when they are unable to meet the minimum warranty requirement set by the federal government for EV vehicles.  ¬†  I will be consulting legal representation to determine what my legal remedies and resolutions may be.¬† I will also be documenting this for other prospective buyers to beware that Nissan is not willing or is not able to meet its warranty obligations.  ¬†  In the meantime, I expect that Nissan will continue to work to repair my vehicle and return it back to me in working order as soon as possible.¬† I would appreciate continuing to receive the bi-weekly follow-ups on the status of that repair going forward.""",2024-04-19 18:24:44,13,39,leaf

Nissan Leaf Electric Vehicle Cut in Half [1592x935],,2019-11-21 12:52:40,2055,54,ThingsCutInHalfPorn
2024 Nissan Leaf,"Hello internet!  Need some help, I'm a big car guy, but don't really know anything about electric cars.  I need to buy a car for my daughter, and the Nissan Leaf seems like a good option.  We don't need range whatsoever, she will be driving at most 5 miles away.  The size is perfect, I see the used values are really low.  We went to dealership today, and with interest rates and rebates, it actually makes more sense to buy new.  $8500 rebate from Nissan, and the Federal Rebate on top, I'm out the door around $22k.  Did a little research online - looks like they are discontinuing the Leaf soon.  I also noticed it looks like within the next few years the Chademo chargers will be going away and I don't want to reply on the possibility of an adapter.    My biggest fear is that this thing will tank even more in value once the Chademo goes away.  Bummer, because it's a great little first car for her.  Any guidance?  Would you consider buying this if you were in my situation, or do you have any alternative suggestions?  Many thanks in advance,",2024-04-20 17:18:01,7,20,electriccars

Nissan Leaf 2013+,"I'm looking to buy a cheaper electric vehicle. The Nissan Leaf looks like to be the best choice so far. I know there are several things to look at to see if it is the updated 2013 model or not. But I only remembered to look in the trunk to see if the middle section is there (pre-update) or without the middle section (post-update). But not all ads have photos of the trunk. What are the other signs to identify the updated Leaf?     And how can I see if it is the SL, SV or standard version? (These are the only versions for the gen1?)  SL is the best. SV is second. And standard is the lowest spec. Is this correct?      Which models/years have the possibility to have the 360 camera? Is it worth the effort/money to look for a version with 360 camera?

Should I buy this 2013 Nissan Leaf? I need some advice on someone familiar with Nissan Leafs,"So I saw a 2013 Nissan Leaf for $4,479. It will be from the original owner, the car has about 78k mileage and it has 12 bars. On 100% charge, he said the car approximates an 85 range and on an 80% charge, it approximates 68 miles. The seller told me that the car will have a range of 85-80 in hot climates, and 75-70 in cold climates (ps. I live in Silicon Valley). My daily commute is 20 miles to school & work and 20 miles back home so total miles of 40-50 miles a day give or take ( 2-3 days a week). I will be in the freeway for 80% of my commute traveling around 65-75 miles an hour (though I can avoid freeways if necessary). I'm just wondering if this car is the best for my circumstances and if should I buy it. I need a car and I'm scared of investing in something that might not fit my situation. I'm also nervous because I saw a lot of people saying that the range in leafs are misleading and quite inaccurate. PLS someone give me some advice",2023-12-18 07:05:49,2,36,leaf

2020 Nissan Leaf SV Plus - Totaled,"A tale of caution for my fellow Leaf owners. My husband and I have owned our 2020 Leaf for a little over two years now - we bought used in 2021. It has always operated in perfect condition - zero issues. At the end of January my husband was driving at dark and in the rain and sadly hit a gigantic pothole that he was unable to avoid going around 30-35mph. In the morning, we thought it might be a flat tire so we drove to the Nissan dealership. Turns out what we thought was a flat tire was actually two broken back wheels and a broken axel with a recommendation we also get two new tires. Insurance covered the damage and we picked the car up after two weeks of service. The next day we needed to charge the car, so we went to our EV Go fast charger nearby. Upon pulling out from our charging session we got the EV Light of Death üíÄ we immediately drove the car back to the dealership and after a week of examining our battery they determined it was damaged by the force of hitting the pothole. We needed a whole new battery and this cost more than the worth of the car - so he is totaled.   Obviously this was a freak accident, but it has lessened our trust in purchasing an EV again - as the batteries cost so much that insurance will almost never cover the replacement if the battery is damaged. At least that has been our experience.   Lastly, please make sure wherever you‚Äôre getting your car serviced confirms that they have an EV technician on site! We have been burned by a Nissan dealership that failed to disclose that to us even though we were asking specific questions regarding this. If they do not have an EV technician they will not be able to diagnose or service anything having to do with your battery.   Hope this post helps others ‚ù§Ô∏è ",2024-03-24 15:13:23,17,34,leaf

EV Emergency Power (Nissan Leaf example),"I‚Äôve been using my 2016 Nissan Leaf for emergency power for several years now.  Mostly for outages due to wind and snow storms.  Longest I‚Äôve gone so far is three days.  I use a 2000W Novopal Pure Sine Wave unit that costs less than $200 on Amazon.  The Leaf has enough power to keep my refrigerator running for about a week or two, plus charge computers/phones, etc.  The Leaf, like most EV‚Äôs, is not intentionally designed to do this.  But EV‚Äôs have two batteries.  The high voltage drive battery (obviously), and there‚Äôs also a 12V battery that runs all the other stuff.  The main trick with an inverter is to hook the inverter up to the 12V battery, and then you have to leave the car powered on.  The main drive battery continuously charges the 12V, so we‚Äôre basically pulling power ‚Äúthrough‚Äù the 12V.  Works great.  The car itself is also my daily driver.  I do about 60 miles a day, and it saves me about $200/month on gas vs. my ICE car.  EV‚Äôs are great, especially if you also have an ICE vehicle for longer trips.  Diversify your fleet, etc.  All the better that you can use them for emergency power in a pinch.  Highly recommend buying one now while the prices are relatively low and considering potential increases in fuel costs due to world events.",2024-04-21 17:29:21,8,16,preppers

"Theoretically, would a Nissan Leaf be the least expensive car for me to own?","**Problem Statement**  I currently own an 07 Chevy Impala I purchased 2015 and have been putting about 12,500 miles per year on it. At the time, I did no research into the expected maintenance, depreciation, and fuel costs. Recently, I decided to try and figure out what car would minimize my transportation costs. Starting out, my assumption was that the best thing to do is keep driving this car until it falls apart. However, after some research I don't think this is my best option.  **Methodology**  * As far as I can tell, Edmunds True Cost to Own provides the best data for the expected costs of new and used cars. The oldest model year for which data is available is 2013. I used Edmunds to estimate repairs, maintenance, and depreciation costs. * For fuel costs, I determined how many city and highway miles I drive per year on average, and then used the city and highway mpg to determine the total gallons I would use. Then, I assumed $2.75/gal cost of gas. * For comparison purposes I did not include insurance since I only carry liability not collision or comprehensive, and I don't think liability would change much based on my car choice. * I computed the costs of my current car and every car that is typically considered economical (a lot of Toyota's, Honda's, etc.).  **2007 Chevy Impala 5 Year Costs (current car):**  This is probably generous, but let's assume that the estimated repairs and maintenance for the 2013 impala are valid for my 07.  Then, my expected costs over the next 5 years are:  * Maintenance and Repairs = $9549 * Fuel = $6640 (specific for my driving habits, not from Edmunds) * Depreciation = $1100 (The depreciation for a 2013 impala is more than my current 07 is worth. Therefore, I took the difference between the KBB value of 07 and 02 Impala as a guess). * Total=$17,289  &#x200B;  **All Results**  Here are all the cars I considered sorted by cost. I looked at 2013 through 2018, but I'm only showing the cheapest model year for each make/model for simplicity (was almost always 2013).  https://preview.redd.it/o7ub9m9644l31.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c5fb820de80a8ab4a273c85de7007a4232d418  From this, it turns out that a 2013 Nissan Leaf would be expected to cost me the least amount of money over the next 5 years:  **2013 Nissan Leaf 5 Year Costs**  * Maintenance and Repairs = $6210 * Fuel = $1394 (specific for my driving habits and local electricity rate, not from Edmunds) * Depreciation = $5332 * Lost Interest = 600 (I would pay cash for the car, but this is the interest I would lose out on in my high yield savings account over the next 5 years due to the upfront cost of purchasing the car versus keeping my Impala. Note that this is actually over-estimating the amount because maintenance and fuel will be lower than impala, allowing me to contribute more to savings account over time.) * Total=$13,534  &#x200B;  I always hear on reddit that the most economical choice is to buy a toyota or honda and run it into the ground, but that wasn't necessarily the case. The biggest trend I see is a lot of electric and hybrid vehicles are near the top of the list, which surprised me.  Do these results agree with your personal experiences? Do you see any major flaws in my analysis? A big limitation is Edmunds TCO only goes back to model year 2013, so I can't compare older cars. I'm completely open to driving older cars, but I just don't know how to evaluate their expected repair costs.  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  **EDIT:**  As some have mentioned, the maintenance and repair costs seem high for both my current impala and the leaf. I've gone through and scaled the maintenance and repairs for all cars by 0.25. Here are the results, sorted by 5 year cost:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/s691di4qy4l31.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=1527b7f608ead2f407a3e1a28d03f93e4506a996  The Chevy spark EV comes out on top, however this is based on an assumed purchase price of $6950. When I look on autotrader the cheapest one within 500 miles is 9600 so I don't think I'll be seeing one for $7000 anytime soon. The 2013 Nissan Leaf is next up, and I am able to find cars within my area for around the assumed price of $7000. Third is my current car, the 07 Impala. After that is a Ford Focus EV, but again I can't actually find anything close to the assumed price near me.  &#x200B;  There have also been some questions about battery degradation and replacement costs. From what I can tell, it is quite expensive at $7,000-$8000, which means that it is probably not worth doing. However, my guess is that is why the leaf depreciates by 76% over the time period and is only worth $1700 by the end. So, in a way this is already taken into account as a cost.",2019-09-07 06:03:43,498,291,Frugal
Nissan leaf battery sudden drop,"I‚Äôve had my Nissan Leaf for around 2.75 years and the battery is still under warranty.   As expected the cars range/efficiency drops when it‚Äôs super hot/on the highway/etc. however, recently if I even approach 70 mph while under 50% the drop range is dramatic. In under 30 seconds will drop ~10% and the drop within a few minutes at 80 mph can be 30%.  Posted a sample video of the occurrence. Is this expected or should I be complaining to Nissan? I went in for the recall/checkup and they stated there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue but this doesn‚Äôt seem normal.  ",2023-09-13 17:05:23,11,45,leaf

Don't Buy a Nissan Leaf! Maintenance fees are a gamble....$7200 PDM repair for a 2019 Leaf,"I  have driven a 2019 Nissan Leaf from March 2019 until October this year  when it broke down and I currently can't afford to fix it.  I am still  paying the 5 year car loan from Nissan but they say I'm just shit out of  luck!  So in early 2019 I was  driving a Toyota Matrix.  One day someone else was driving my car and  got into a minor accident, it was an older model and ended up being a  write off.  A family member of mine  had an idea for a local car share in my area and had told me about it.   I asked him about using a car since mine was currently no more.  He  told me to go pick up a new nissan Leaf from the dealership and use it  while he gets the software in order.  18 months later he decided there  was no software he could use that would make it worth the cost and asked  me to take over the payments.  The first 18 months were pretty good,  many fast chargers were also free in this time and I didn't pay anything  for the car.  Any limitations of the car were offset by the completely  free to drive nature.  The free ride eventually came to an end and now I  am paying off the car and paying for charging.  After  the first winter the battery had a significant loss of range that never  got back to what it was the first summer of use.  After the third  winter the battery would suddenly drop from 60% to 15% then jump back up  to 55% and etc.  Nissan says that the battery is still good, so getting  no warranty so far on this.  Now the fast charging is limited, and  often throttled.  Throttling is supposed to save the battery but it  wasn't enough I guess.  Now in  October of 2023 I have a minor accident on the rear side of the car, but  after that point my car had continued electrical issues with the EV  system, at first it was not charging to full on level 2, then not  working and giving Check EV system warning after a fast charge session  at a trusted charger.  At first they said just switch the 12V battery  and I did and it worked for a time.  But then It kept giving the warning  and I would have to detach the 12V battery and reattach to reset the  error code and it would drive for a while until it came back.  Now it  has stopped accepting level 2 charge.  Brought it back to nissan and  they say the PDM is not working and want $7200 to fix it.  At this point  I make the claim on my insurance as it all started after my collision.  Nissan  tells me that they don't know what caused the PDM to fail as they don't  diagnose them.  But they told the insurance adjuster that it definitely  wasn't my collision that made it fail.  But they will tell me they  don't know how it failed because they wont actually look inside for the  broken fuse.  So now I have a 4.5  year old car I am still paying off the 5 year car loan on, but don't  have the cash on hand today to pay Nissan $7200 to fix my car.  They  tell me that it wasn't my accident, the part just fails!  Please pay us  $7200 to drive again!  Whats the lifetime of this part?  I am at  135,000km on this car, I have driven and charged a lot, but am I  supposed to price in 5c/km driven for new PDMs in my leaf?  Shitty  parts and shitty service means I will never buy a Nissan again.  That's  an unacceptable maintenance cost for an electric vehicle.  What electric vehicle is going to have the best lifespan is my question?  In the market for a new lease....",2023-12-23 02:49:51,14,54,electricvehicles

Found a guy with 8 Nissan leaf batteries. Help me out.,"So, I've wanted to get an EV for a while. I found a 2012 Leaf in good condition with a blown battery listed for $1,500 (could possibly talk them into $1,000) plus this guy that has these battles for $1,000. How would I know what capacity they are? He doesn't seem to know what he has and is selling them for a low price, but I live in a very spread out city, so a regular 2012 Leaf battery probably couldn't cut it where I'm living. Just getting to my friends theater he works at and back is over 50 miles. So ideally I'd want the 40kwh pack at minimum. Pretty sure there are zero chademo fast chargers near me as well because I'm in a red state in the USA that tries its hardest to not be progressive. So I guess what I'm asking, is how do I learn the capacity on those batteries and also do you think I should go for it if I can get the car and battery for that cheap? It would be my first ev. I have driven a Tesla, but can't afford one. This would be my quickest foot in the door. But like I said, zero chademo near me.

Nissan Leaf gets way too much hate.,"I've had a 2019 SV Leaf for a couple of months now.  It's a second vehicle that I use for commuting to work and driving around the Portland area and with longer drives we take our Minivan with the kids.    It's truly be an absolutely wonderful second car and I've learned just how much (or little, in this case) driving I do.  I can easily go 3-4 days without needing to charge it and if I do I just plug it into a 110 and it charges in 24 hours or so.  It's a perfect complimentary vehicle.  It uses tried and true technology so you know it's a reliable vehicle versus taking a shot in the dark at the newer generation vehicles.  So...why is it when you go to r/electricvehicles as an example is the Leaf significantly looked down on?  Surely, the super early 2011-2013 models had bad battery issues but it hasn't really been a thing in a while.  You only experience rapidgate when you do 3+ fast charges at a time.  People act like they do this all the time, but for most Americans this is at most something you do 3-5 times a year, if even that.  I just don't understand why this car gets so much negative feedback.  It's wonderful!",2022-02-17 17:55:13,67,101,leaf
Three Months of EV Ownership: They Aren't Ready for Road Trips.,"Special disclaimer for r/cars: I take 400+ mile round trips 3-5 times a month. I drive far more often than the average American. People who say they can't own an EV because it will add 1-2 hours to the 1-2 trips they take per year are being absolutely ridiculous. Having said that...   I've had my Rivian R1T for three months now, I absolutely love it. I drive a fair amount for work, and after 4-5 trips of 3-400 miles one way, I've come to the conclusion that EV's aren't ready for road trips yet.   Sorry EV crowd, but EV owners are a bit gaslighty when it comes to making road trips. As a group people like to pretend like the stops aren't that long, or you don't have to stop that often, or that the level 3 charger definitely isn't 15 minutes in the wrong direction.   1. Charging Time. It takes way, way longer to charge a car than it does to fill one up with gas.  It takes 5 minutes or less to fill a car up. Depending on how far you need to go, charging can be in excess of an hour. Thankfully I live in a part of the country where there is not a ton of EV's so I've never had to wait for a charger. Waiting for people complete a process that takes 20-90 minutes while trying to get somewhere would be a dealbreaker for me.   2. Charging Network. Its just not ready. Forget the reliability issues, at least in the middle of the country, it's just not widespread enough. The lack of availability means that not only could it be 10+ minutes in the wrong direction to get to the charger, it means you might have to do weird stuff like stop 100 miles into your trip and charge to ~100% just to be able to make it. Oh, and hopefully the chargers work, and charge at a reasonable speed.   3. Range/Aero/Weather. You have to stop more often, you have to drive slower. What a terrible combo. Allegedly my trucks range in conserve mode is 293 miles, but you can't drive that far at 70 mph, definitely not at 75, and sure as fuck not going to happen at 80. Driving into a headwind or in the cold or both? You could reduce your range by 50% or more. That's just not acceptable, my previous ICE vehicle, horrible efficiency meant a 20% reduction in range.  I have a route I run fairly often that's right at 300 miles one way. In my previous ICE vehicle I had a fairly standard routine, I'd stop halfway fill up, bathroom and hit the drive through, 15-20 minute stop. If I didn't need to eat, or use the restroom, I could make it without stopping.  Making this same trip in the Rivian, it's 120 miles to the charger, which is 10 minutes in the wrong direction. 189 miles from the charger to the destination, which means I need to charge to 90%+. Depending on how efficient the first leg was and how the charger is behaving, that's 30-60 minutes. So 20 minutes of extra driving, then 30-60 minutes of charging. You're adding 30-60 minutes of stopping time vs the ICE vehicle. You need to stop multiple times and you really start piling on the time.   I love my truck, and I honestly don't mind a 1 stop trip, I make it my food stop and bathroom stop and the extra time isn't too hateful. I won't take an EV beyond 1 charger stop and we won't be selling the ICE vehicle. It's just not ready.",2022-12-27 12:06:03,3040,1098,cars
18 months of EV ownership in Australia: real world experience,"I posted a version of this in r/carsaustralia but thought it might also be of interest to a wider audience, given it‚Äôs an ongoing hot topic.  We bought a Tesla Model 3 SR+ in May 2021. I‚Äôd driven one a few months earlier as I wasn‚Äôt keen on EVs but wanted to see for myself. I‚Äôm a car guy first and foremost but with an environmental conscience; I just liked ICE engines and manual transmissions. Totally changed my mind. Couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how good it was afterwards, so we decided to replace my wife‚Äôs car with one.  Our use case is well suited to EV ownership. The extreme cold issues are not applicable to us in the way they seem to affect people in the US. We have easy access to charging at home, and have rooftop solar panels, so in effect if the car is home a lot during the day (and it is), then we are recharging it from a clean power source for free. We also don‚Äôt tow anything, so concerns about range dropping in those circumstances are irrelevant to us.  We had expected to only use it as a suburban car, and use our ICE family car for the longer trip we take every month or two (Sydney to Canberra so about 300km each way). However, rising fuel costs and the fact that the Model 3 is a really nice road trip car now means that we use it for those trips too. 300km at freeway speeds is well within the car‚Äôs capabilities so we only stop to recharge if we didn‚Äôt leave home fully charged. I estimate it could do 350km at those speeds but haven‚Äôt pushed it that far.  In the time we‚Äôve had it, fast charging locations on that trip have increased from two to four, so the convenience has improved significantly. Having said that, our regular trip is along Australia‚Äôs major east coast route where you‚Äôd expect to find the best infrastructure.   I‚Äôve only had to wait twice for access to a public fast charger, and since that happened the number of units atone of those locations has gone from 2 to 4. (The other was the one and only fast charger in Cowra so we used the slow one instead).  I know people object to needing to stop every few hours to charge on a longer road trip. We haven‚Äôt done a longer trip than 300km or so in this car. Personally I don‚Äôt like to drive more than 2-3 hours at a time for fatigue management reasons, plus TBH I usually need to pee by then and/or want food or coffee, so it would make little difference to my progress on a longer trip.  The thing about charging - and I misunderstood this too before getting an EV - is that you need to change your mindset. You don‚Äôt refuel when it‚Äôs nearly empty, you plug it in whenever you‚Äôre not using it. ABC: Always Be Charging. That way you easily top up the 20-100km you might do on a typical day. But: that‚Äôs convenient if you can charge at home (plug in and go do something else), but would be much less so if you had to do all your charging at a public facility.  Running costs have been super low. Aside from most of our recharging being free, we‚Äôve spent no money on servicing beyond a tyre rotation, and haven‚Äôt needed tyres yet at nearly 50,000km. We‚Äôve had no faults whatsoever and no build quality concerns.  And I genuinely enjoy how it drives - it‚Äôs fast, responsive, smooth, and quiet. Perfect daily.  For us, there have been no downsides. However, as things stand an EV probably won‚Äôt work well for you if: - you can‚Äôt afford an expensive new car, because the upfront cost is substantial (albeit improving) and Australia doesn‚Äôt subsidise purchasing like other places do; - you can‚Äôt charge at home/work; - you need to tow regularly; - you travel long distances through areas poorly served by fast chargers; or - you really do need to drive 4+ hours at a time without stopping.  Oh, there is one downside: getting into lots of discussions with people about EVs. Fine when they are genuinely interested; annoying if they just want to regurgitate anti-EV talking points that have been disproven repeatedly. Off the internet most interactions are positive, and people come up to us and ask questions politely (kids really love Teslas as it turns out!); online it‚Äôs a cesspit.  We still run two ICE cars, one being my daily. That will likely be replaced with an EV when the time comes. The other - being a manual V8 - will get rolled out on weekends and so on as time goes on. I can see a future day when ICE cars in cities are a weekends and public holidays thing and I‚Äôd support that once EVs become affordable and widespread.  Hope that‚Äôs been of interest. For us, it‚Äôs been an absolute win.",2022-12-28 18:12:53,2269,692,australia
Hidden Costs of EV Ownership?,"I‚Äôm a long time lurker on this sub, and have loved EVs for an even longer time. But every time I bring up the prospect of owning one, my mom points out the cost of insurance will be much higher, as well as registering the vehicle.  To those of you who own an EV, I‚Äôm curious what your experiences are with the difference in cost compared to an ICE vehicle. I‚Äôm a recent college grad and don‚Äôt have much disposable income at the moment. I want to make an EV purchase work, but worried about the additional cost of ownership beyond the sale price.  Is getting a used EV better? Are there insurance options that work best? Will rates go down to match ice cars as EVs grow in prevalence? TYA",2024-04-12 01:26:52,45,266,electricvehicles

EV Ownership hidden Cost,"I have owned an ID4 for two years now and am an evangelist for EV ownership.  I have had more than a handful of conversations with people stopped in their tracks to ownership by the cost of adding a charger to their homes.  I live in a neighborhood with lots of older houses and I have heard that the cost of upgrading their electrical panel is the blockade.  I know there is a tax incentive for the charger but is there any incentives for upgrading the electrical panels?  I have heard it costs up to 5k to have a panel upgraded and if you added the charger and the feed to the panel, you could be looking at between 2k - 3k.  So you are looking at 8k  on top of the cost of the EV.",2023-11-09 16:49:34,0,121,electricvehicles
1 Month of EV ownership.,"My experience after 1 month of owning a Tesla Model Y is highly positive. I have done 4,000km and my driving habits are no different than in my previous petrol and diesel cars. With my home charger what is hugely different is my savings in fuel. Fast charging has been a breeze, the car is ready before I have finished my bathroom break.  There is a lot of negativity in the media recently regarding EVs. I think many ICE drivers see EVs as a threat to their ownership of an ICE vehicle. Really they should be seen as a complement in the choice of vehicles available to consumers.  Probably what does not help the situation are the number of really bad EVs that were rushed out by manufacturers based on ICE platforms that are overpriced for what they offer.",2024-04-15 17:00:22,32,61,evs_ireland

EV Ownership In Buffalo,"I am thinking about moving to an EV from a VERY fuel efficient sedan.  I don't intend to travel long distances with the vehicle just basically use it as a daily driver within a 125-150 mile range.    My question for those that have made the transition to EV's in WNY, is it practical, economical and enjoyable in your opinion?  Are you glad you went to an EV or do you have regrets?  I feel like not only is gas expensive, but so is electricity in WNY.  I have NYSEG and after taxes, fees and all the crap added on the bill, it is about $.30/kWh.  There are other intangibles like much lower maintenance costs, some ""free"" places to charge and the typical quiet and comfort that I personally have experienced when in an EV.  Also, charging the car in your garage and never need to go to a gas station for gas.  Thanks in advance for your input and opinions.  GO BILLS!  &#x200B;",2023-12-23 20:12:40,9,73,Buffalo
1 Year Analysis of EV ownership in Massachusetts,"Here is an analysis / review of 1 year of ownership of my Mach E in Massachusetts.   TLDR: Electricity in MA is expensive and gas is not tremendously expensive.  I drove approximately 10,000 miles last year. This is pretty much my annual average, and is a mix of Highway and town. I previously drove a Jeep wrangler and average just about 20 mpg.   As per the US energy Information website   [https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm\_epm0\_pte\_sma\_dpg&f=m](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_sma_dpg&f=m)  MA average gas price for 2023 was $3.60 (all grades)/gal. This means my 10000 mile would have cost approximately $1800.  &#x200B;  I have Solar panels (Decided to install when I made the decision to go EV).   My current rate for electricity - Eversource Eastern MA R1 A1 - is $0.40/kWh - There is no Off Peak charging rate. I have an EVSE at home. I charged outside my home probably 4 times all year - I have not included that in my analysis. As per my charger I consumed 4342 kWh for a cost of $1737. Approximately 2.3 mi/kWh.   Needless to say switching to an EV is really a wash for the cost of gas. Will have to wait a few years to determine the TCO for the vehicle (so far I have had no costs other than charging), that said going EV was probably the best decision.",2024-01-01 17:37:35,51,113,electricvehicles
EV Ownership - One Year In,"G'day,  Thought I'd throw down some thoughts after now owning an EV for a year.   We came from a 2013 Mazda CX-9, which was top of the line. Very big (we have two young kids), but also very expensive to run... around $140 a week in petrol. It had also started to develop issues with the ignition system, and we'd spent about $4K recently on it. It was at about 120,000kms.  I'd been considering EVs as a replacement, but the cost seemed well beyond our budget, until the FBT changes were introduced. We've a standard range Tesla Model Y on a 5 year lease.  It costs $358 a week for the lease pre-tax, at the 37% tax rate, this comes down to about $225/week. This includes a budget for all running costs, tyres, rego, insurance etc. of around $4K a year. There is a 21K balloon payment at the end should we want to keep the car. Total cost over 5 years is then around $79K, assuming we use all of the $20K of running costs that are budgeted. At the time, the cost for the car outright was $78K.   We do have a solar system here, the car is driven to work Mon-Thurs, and then is also used on the weekend, in practice we're able to use solar for between 60-70% of charging the car. We use ChargeHQ to control charging when we have excess solar. We use a standard 15A wall socket to charge. We could make use of more solar if we had a faster means of charging the car, but it would take a while to offset the cost of getting that installed.  Working out the actual cost of what you're spending can be difficult because there are ""losses"". When charging a car, it's not 100% efficient, there are features on a Tesla like ""Sentry"" mode, which whilst very handy, chew a lot of power when the car is parked.  There is about a 60KW pack in the car, we average 140wh per km, giving a total range of 428KM - take with a fist of salt, efficiency van cary a lot.  Charging from solar where we would be paid 6c per KWh is $3.60 for a ""tank"". Charging from the grid where we pay 25c is more like $15. These figures are about about 10% under ""real"" figures once you factor in the above mentioned losses.  We typically use between 250-300KWh a month.  There is fast charging, which we've never had to actually do, but have tried a few times just for the novelty and to understand how it works. Otherwise, all charging has just been at home.  Range anxiety is not a thing. I \_do\_ however find myself micromanage charging the car, not because I need to, but because I want to use as much solar as I can.   We haven't done any real road trips in it yet, however we do have one planned from SEQ to Sydney later this year.  For maintenance, we've rotated the tyres (picked up a screw, so had it in the shop getting patched anyway) and have put water in the windscreen wiper system. That is it.   If I could change anything, it would be that the 2022 models have the very firm suspension, which was addressed in 2023 - that's my only gripe about the car, everything else has been great. There are a lot of little benefits that all add up. The car has been updated several times to add significant new features. You can do things like start the AC and have the car cooled down by the time you get to it. You can view the cameras remotely. The ""autopilot"" (not to be confused with ""full-self driving) is basically adaptive cruise control + lane keeping. On motorways it is very effective at basically driving itself.

Three Months of EV Ownership: They aren't ready for road trips,"I've had my Rivian R1T for three months now, I absolutely love it. I drive a fair amount for work, and after 4-5 trips of 3-400 miles one way, I've come to the conclusion that EV's aren't ready for road trips yet.   Sorry EV crowd, but EV owners are a bit gaslighty when it comes to making road trips. As a group people like to pretend like the stops aren't that long, or you don't have to stop that often, or that the level 3 charger definitely isn't 15 minutes in the wrong direction.   1. Charging Time. It takes way, way longer to charge a car than it does to fill one up with gas.  It takes 5 minutes or less to fill a car up. Depending on how far you need to go, charging can be in excess of an hour. Thankfully I live in a part of the country where there is not a ton of EV's so I've never had to wait for a charger. Waiting for people complete a process that takes 20-90 minutes while trying to get somewhere would be a dealbreaker for me.   2. Charging Network. Its just not ready. Forget the reliability issues, at least in the middle of the country, it's just not widespread enough. The lack of availability means that not only could it be 10+ minutes in the wrong direction to get to the charger, it means you might have to do weird stuff like stop 100 miles in to your trip and charge to ~100% just to be able to make it. Oh, and hopefully the chargers work, and charge at a reasonable speed.   3. Range/Aero/Weather. You have to stop more often, you have to drive slower. What a terrible combo. Allegedly my trucks range in conserve mode is 293 miles, but you can't drive that far at 70 mph, definitely not at 75, and sure as fuck not going to happen at 80. Driving into a headwind or in the cold or both? You could reduce your range by 50% or more. That's just not acceptable, my previous ICE vehicle, horrible efficiency meant a 20% reduction in range.

How much money (if any) EV ownership saves depends on where you live,"Interesting article I came across recently, basically the upshot is that whether or not an EV costs less than an ICE (total cost of ownership over 25 years) depends on which city you live in, whether you can charge at home, and whether you get time-of-use discounts on power rates.  https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1141944_how-much-money-ev-ownership-saves-depends-on-where-you-live  Some takeaways I found interesting:  * If you can charge at home, even in the worst-case cities the total cost of ownership of an EV is only slightly worse than an ICE.  * If you can't charge at home an EV is usually the most expensive option.  * In most cities a hybrid is currently the cheapest option in terms of overall cost of ownership.",2024-01-09 16:45:14,115,140,cars

6 Month Update 2023 Niro EV/First EV ownership,"For folks wondering about EV or Kia Niro ownership, I've been leasing mine for 6 months now.   I've never owned a new car, and never imagined leasing, but this was a zero down, 10k miles per year, 24 month lease. After state rebate, it ends up being around $25 per month out of pocket (plus higher insurance premium since it is a new EV.)   I'm 6 months, and 5200 miles into the lease.   &#x200B;  **Thoughts on EV**  1. I'm sold on leasing an EV. The federal and state rebates make it an amazing deal. It is important to factor in increased insurance and high registration cost.  2. I installed a proper level 2 charger in my garage. Again, REBATES. Between fed, county and electric company, I came out ahead. Having said that, I almost never use it. I installed it in our double garage where my daughter parks. I park in a tight single garage and just plug into the wall. I've had to use the fast charger out of necessity twice in 6 months. The rest of the time a trickle charger is fine. I assumed I would be charging all the time. Nope.  3. Free public chargers are a thing of beauty. My church has one. I use it when I play in the band. 5 hrs of glorious free charge.  4. I've never been stranded and never needed to slow a trip based on charging. Note: this EV is a second car, but is my primary car. 5. I've never used the free ElectrifyAmerica charging yet. There aren't many near me and several are out of commission when I try.   **Thoughts on Niro specifically:**   1. It's a lovely and fun car. VERY quick even with the detuned torque for the 2023 model.  2. It really needed winter tires (Denver, CO area.) They made it a true all season vehicle.  3. Summer mileage range is typically 275 - 290. Mid winter range is around 220. Frosty winter range is 160 - 180.  4. The Media Center infuriates me. Its default seems to be 'media off' rather than 'last media used.' I often have to push too many buttons to get back to Apple CarPlay which is what I use 98% of the time.  5. I much prefer buttons to screen, so Kia wins easily over Tesla for me.   When the lease is up, I'd happily lease another Niro. If price was right, I'd get an Ioniq5 in a heartbeat though.   &#x200B;  I doubt we'll go full electric as a family, but I am intrigued by the main car being a PHEV and the second car being an EV. Seems ideal. ",2024-04-13 15:36:40,6,12,KiaNiroEV

The quick point I‚Äôm trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question ‚Äì and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule ‚Äì seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems ‚Äì for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**  **Part 2 ‚Äì Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**  * From an investment into equities point of view ‚Äì S&P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month ‚Äî other than a slight dip in February ‚Äî over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022)   * Let‚Äôs take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it‚Äôs a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).     * Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)   * In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx).   * As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states.

This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/)   * The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html)   * Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)    * States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois‚Äô clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/).   * By 2030, there‚Äôs expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market.

Canoo‚Äôs Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else‚Äôs lineup‚Ä¶ take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses.   It is this modular platform that led to Apple‚Äôs interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car‚Äôs electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).  Apple wasn‚Äôt the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia‚Äôs parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‚Äòpretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal‚Ä¶ Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company‚Äô [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia).   Ultimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo‚Äôs chairman didn‚Äôt feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn‚Äôt factor in the value of Canoo‚Äôs IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo‚Äôs own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev)   Regarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world‚Äôs flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo‚Äôs suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).  Let‚Äôs take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo‚Äôs approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c).   The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo‚Äôs vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:  * 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed  * 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants  * >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.  These enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo‚Äôs new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 ‚Äì layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977)   The three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:  Lifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It‚Äôs pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I‚Äôd recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):  * Launching late 2022.  * Starting at $34,750*  * 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats  * 250 mi range  * Up to 350 Horsepower   * 28min charge time 80%  * 188 ft¬≥ interior volume  * 80 KWh battery  * 1,464 lbs payload ‚Äì 2,000 lbs capacity  Multi-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) ‚Äì Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):  * Starting at $33,000*  * 200 ft¬≥ - 500 ft¬≥ cargo volume  * 130 ‚Äì 230 mi, 90 ‚Äì 190 mi range (EPA)  * 1,540 to 1,980 lbs  Pickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) ‚Äì All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility ‚Äî ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):  * Launching as early as 2023.  * Price ‚Äì Not currently listed, but during the Q&A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category ‚Äì you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)    * Targeted HP ‚Äì 500+  * Payload Capacity ‚Äì 1800 lbs  * Range ‚Äì 200+ mi  * Powertrain ‚Äì AWD or RWD  There‚Äôs actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn‚Äôt been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714).   We can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It‚Äôs important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity ‚Äì highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda).   Canoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer ‚Äì with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 ‚Äì 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).  To sum it up ‚Äì Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).  **Part 4 ‚Äì Recent Updates**  **Now let‚Äôs take a look at some of the hires that the company‚Äôs been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

The company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.  At a pre-revenue stage there‚Äôs not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:  * Over 9,500 non-binding preorders ‚Äì which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).  * 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).  As far as valuations go, let‚Äôs divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look ‚Äì based on their market cap. I‚Äôm sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I‚Äôll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.  * Lucid Motors ‚Äì $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021  * Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021   * Fisker Inc - $3.917B, >17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000   * Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022   * Canoo ‚Äì $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV   * Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B  Just looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven‚Äôt done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there‚Äôs a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo‚Äôs cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).    **Part 6 ‚Äì Bear Case**  With anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that‚Äôs pretty much it in a sentence. Since I‚Äôm on the bullish side for the company, I‚Äôll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won‚Äôt be running out of $$$ before it comes to market ‚Äì these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I‚Äôll summarize them below:  * As of Canoo‚Äôs second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market.   * Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.  * EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.  * The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production ‚Äì H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense to go the additional equity route.  * In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) ‚Äì nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.  **Part 7 ‚Äì SI and Squeeze Potential**  I know y‚Äôall have just been waiting for this so I‚Äôll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that‚Äôll help understand GOEV‚Äôs squeezability.  * Short Interest ‚Äì 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float   * Market Cap ‚Äì $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it‚Äôs immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital  * Extremely Memeable ‚Äì I mean‚Ä¶ GOEV, like Go‚Ä¶ EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria  * Low Liquidity ‚Äì Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)  * Low Risk (IV) ‚Äì Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you‚Äôre one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it‚Äôs not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There‚Äôs not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn‚Äôt have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I‚Äôd agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.  **Part 8 ‚Äì TL;DR**  The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership.   President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at <$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly.   Canoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.  To facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world‚Äôs flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo‚Äôs Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else‚Äôs lineup‚Ä¶ take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo‚Äôs vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.  * 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed  * 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)  * >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.  If we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it‚Äôs $4,000 rebate ‚Äì that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you‚Äôre getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.  If you made it this far, I‚Äôd like to thank you for reading this ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won‚Äôt). They‚Äôre extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company ‚Äì from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups.

Thoughts on coming months and years on EV ownership in NZ,"We would like to own an EV for all the normal benefits; environmental, financial and reliability (especially with very short distance driving) but worried about changes in next couple of years making it a bad financial decision.  In some ways we‚Äôd be the ideal EV owner; financially comfortable, live about 10 km from work, off street parking for charging, have another car for long distance, able to get an interest free loan through mortgage, somewhat environmentally aware, would be replacing two 20 year old cars with it  However I‚Äôve been gun shy about actually doing it for a couple of reasons.  Firstly worried that battery tech is on the verge of making a massive break through and the car would be obsolete very quickly and worth nothing   Secondly the financial side currently makes sense without RUC‚Äôs, however much less logical in the very near future where they‚Äôre implemented on electric cars  Thoughts?",2023-12-04 00:21:25,8,70,nzev

4 Years of Soul EV Ownership,"Hey guys and gals, just discovered this group, I hope posting about EVs here is okay. My name is Eric, I live on Vancouver Island in British Columbia Canada. I'm a EV certified automotive red seal technician, and my 2015 Kia Soul EV + has to be one of the best cars I've owned. There seems to be limited information on these EVs and mixed owner reviews, so I thought I'd give an honest account of my ownership to this interested.  I bought it almost exactly 4 years ago with about 94,000kms from a Mini dealer in Vancouver when I had been living in the area. I had been driving a 1988 Chevrolet Caprice that I spent a lot of time and money on, fixing and restoring it, and had even put in a 370hp SBC crate engine into it (still wasn‚Äôt very fast btw). I was starting to get a little bit tired of constantly having to deal with constant old car things like leaky weather strips and the fuel bill. I realized that potential car payments and insurance would be less than it would be to keep fixing and filling the fuel tank on my Caprice.  I started looking at cheap used EVs, and at the time, the only vehicles that were under $20k were the Nissan Leaf, Smart For2 Electrics, Fiat 500e exported from the states, and the Kia Soul. The Fiat didn‚Äôt have a warranty as a result of being a vehicle from the states, and the Smart didn‚Äôt have DCFC (The Fiat doesn‚Äôt have it either). That left the Leaf and the Soul and my only real options. Looking into it, there was a clearly superior vehicle. The Soul, and while info was a bit limited, it looked pretty good. I liked the larger interior space, they were available with heated and ventilated leather (None of the others had this), and had an generous 8 year/160k km warranty.   I went out searching and ended up buying cheapest one I could find that was close to me, turned out to be perfect. It had a clean title, had the + package (Luxury for the USA), but it was not equipped with a sunroof. I know a lot of people like sunroofs, but I‚Äôve had to clear way too many sunroof drains and quote too many $8k sunroof frame replacement jobs at my dealer job for my comfort. They are the bane of my existence and I pity people that have to pay to fix them.  The vehicle was far from perfect. The car had come from Vancouver Island, and I have the sneaking suspicion that somebody must have been using it as a parcel delivery vehicle because of 2 reasons. Firstly, the vehicle was a little beat up. It has scratches on the hood from somebody dragging the charging cable across it, dents in the door jams from the driver closing the door on the seat belt buckle, and has some broken interior panels. The second reason is that unbeknownst to me at the time (I had very limited EV experience at the time) the high voltage battery was effectively cooked when I got it from the dealer and only had 90km of range. I was okay with all of this given the price of the vehicle.  I had been living in Vancouver at the time, so me and a buddy went on a short trip to Squamish to celebrate my new purchase. Going there wasn‚Äôt an issue and we charged there, but heading back we unexpectedly had a 30km range drop, and had to limp to the nearest level 2 charger as there were no level 3 stations within range. We charged it enough to get us to the next level 3 and got home after.   I took it to the Kia dealer and I had the high voltage battery replaced under warranty for free. However sadly I got the same 27.5 kWh put back in (Oh well, it was free) instead of the 30 kWh packs that some other owners reported getting put in theirs, but I was back in business with 165km range. I was super excited about the range I had just gained, so in addition to using the vehicle exclusively for commuting, but I started slowly pushing the limits of the vehicle and it‚Äôs range. I‚Äôve been really good about keeping the battery between 20-80% SOC, but I haven‚Äôt exactly been shy of straying and charging to 100% once a week or so. I started using the Torque app combined with imported data PIDS courtesy of APRP on my phone that I connected to the vehicle using an OBD2 dongle I had on hand already and started monitor vehicle status. Battery read 110% SOH at this point in the vehicle‚Äôs life.  I ended up having to move to Vancouver Island during the pandemic for a job opportunity, and I‚Äôve been doing a 66km round trip commute 5 days a week for a little over 3 years now, I end up putting about 25,000kms a year on the vehicle (It currently has about 191,000kms), and it‚Äôs been pretty good reliability wise. I had to replace the onboard charger (OBC) out of warranty for about $2000 CDN at about 170,000km, but even with a failed on board charger, I was still able to charge the vehicle at a level 3 station as it bypasses the OBC.  The vehicle had aftermarket 16‚Äù rims and new tires on it when I bought it, but I ended up damaging the tire on a pothole. The other tires were getting down to about 40%, so I opted to buy a new set of 18‚Äù rims and high performance Continental tires for it, and I installed a good set of winter tires on the old rims for winter use later that year. The 18‚Äù rims ended up cutting my range by about 25kms, but the range sacrifice was worth it in my opinion.  Not only do I love the looks of them, but the handling of the vehicle is significantly improved. Before I replaced the rims I had taken the vehicle to Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit through the company I was working for at the time and took it around the track for the afternoon, the biggest limiting factor going around corners turned out to be the tires folding under themselves when going around corners hard. It was honestly really frustrating because I could tell the car had more to give. It had a good amount of body roll, but less than you may expect given then battery placement. But ultimately it was just limited by the tires. That being said, I was actually able to pass a couple Mk7 Golf GTI‚Äôs that were running the circuit with me when we got to the corners. And yes I was very nauseous after haha  I ended up driving it from Nanaimo to Prince George late spring last year to see family along a 1,588km round trip, staying in Kamloops overnight to visit other family. I‚Äôve always known the car is more of a city commuter, not a road trip king, but I did the trip just to prove that it could do it. And it did! It however definitely struggled. The new 145km summer range meant I had to stop at 24 total DCFC stations on my entire trip, and we all know if there‚Äôs one thing EV batteries don‚Äôt like it‚Äôs constant fast charging and the heat that comes with it. I ended up learning a bunch of stuff about battery cooling on the vehicle.  I learned that there‚Äôs an air intake under both of the front seats that is sucked in my a fan located in the cargo area where the spare would normally be. That air is sucked in and is directed in between the pouch style battery cells (Didn‚Äôt know the Soul used this style of battery, all other EVs I know of use laptop style cells) to cool the battery. Cooling the battery this way was Kia‚Äôs biggest mistake. Air cooling is not sufficient to cool a battery for multiple DCFC sessions. The first couple charges aren‚Äôt too big of a deal, but by the end of the 3rd charge the battery was already above 40¬∞c. It‚Äôs at this temperature that the vehicle turns the cooling fan to max and starts dialing back the charge rate, but temps continue to climb with the charge rate being turned down and down as to not damage the EV battery.  So I came up with a partial ‚ÄúFix‚Äù, and that term really does belong in quotations. I turned the A/C to max, directed the air flow to the feet, took a couple old Glosette boxes and modified it so that the rear passenger foot vent air was directed into the battery cooling intakes. But did it work? In a word, sorta. It only was able to bring battery temps down by a couple extra degrees by the next charging station (I needed more like 10¬∞c), but it was able to keep the battery temp from rising as fast compared to before, but ultimately the same result occurred. Was it worth it and would I recommend other Soul EV owners do the same? Absolutely not. It was more of an experiment than anything to see if I could make the journey any easier. What ended up helping the most was reducing the speed at which I drove at on the freeway as to put less of a strain on the EV battery. Despite all of this, I‚Äôm glad it had the air cooling. I would imagine the same trip with similar range Leaf and it‚Äôs non-cooled battery would  probably have failed to make the trip. But that‚Äôs pure speculation.  Fast forward to today on the opposite side of things, we just experienced a cold snap and got temps as cold as -10¬∞c . While not super cold compared for much of Canada, it‚Äôs still pretty cold for us here on the island. My battery was reading as low as 0¬∞ (My apartment has an underground so it only spend 9 hours outside that day while it was parked at work) and range dipped to about 120km. It‚Äôs during this time of year that I get to use one of my favourite features, climate scheduling. I plug in at home and at work, set the timer for when I need to leave, and get into a warm and cozy car. Obviously not as fancy as those of you on here with app connected vehicles, but it‚Äôs fine given the age of the vehicle and the fact it doesn‚Äôt require a subscription leaves me quite happy.  Now at 190,000kms, it's still managed to maintain 110% SOH. I honestly have no idea how it‚Äôs gone almost 100,000kms and it's not only still above the rated comp city, it's maintained it. I‚Äôm thrilled honestly. I keep drooling at some of these new EVs, the Polestar 2 really catches my attention. But I keep driving this little Kia trouble free kilometer after trouble free kilometer and it makes me kinda love it and makes me wanna keep it. Even my partner has warmed up to it. He absolutely hated it when he first set his eyes upon it saying he hated the styling, but once he started to drive it and learn why I chose it he started to realize it was a pretty good car. Overall, I‚Äôm glad I took the risk. If I had to do it again, I definitely would. 10/10 ownership experience",2024-01-20 14:34:36,23,18,KiaSoulClub

My 4 Years of EV ownership,"Hey guys and gals, just discovered this group and thought I'd come share my thoughts after 4 years of EV ownership! My name is Eric, I live on Vancouver Island in British Columbia Canada. I'm a EV certified automotive red seal technician, and my 2015 Kia Soul EV + has to be one of the best cars I've owned.  I bought it almost exactly 4 years ago with about 94,000kms from a Mini dealer in Vancouver when I had been living in the area. I had been driving a 1988 Chevrolet Caprice that I spent a lot of time and money on, fixing and restoring it, and had even put in a 370hp SBC crate engine into it (still wasn‚Äôt very fast btw). I was starting to get a little bit tired of constantly having to deal with constant old car things like leaky weather strips and the fuel bill. I realized that potential car payments and insurance would be less than it would be to keep fixing and filling the fuel tank on my Caprice.  I started looking at cheap used EVs, and at the time, the only vehicles that were under $20k were the Nissan Leaf, Smart For2 Electrics, Fiat 500e exported from the states, and the Kia Soul. The Fiat didn‚Äôt have a warranty as a result of being a vehicle from the states, and the Smart didn‚Äôt have DCFC (The Fiat doesn‚Äôt have it either). That left the Leaf and the Soul and my only real options. Looking into it, there was a clearly superior vehicle. The Soul, and while info was a bit limited, it looked pretty good. I liked the larger interior space, they were available with heated and ventilated leather (None of the others had this), and had an generous 8 year/160k km warranty.   I went out searching and ended up buying cheapest one I could find that was close to me, turned out to be perfect. It had a clean title, had the + package (Luxury for the USA), but it was not equipped with a sunroof. I know a lot of people like sunroofs, but I‚Äôve had to clear way too many sunroof drains and quote too many $8k sunroof frame replacement jobs at my dealer job for my comfort. They are the bane of my existence and I pity people that have to pay to fix them.  The vehicle was far from perfect. The car had come from Vancouver Island, and I have the sneaking suspicion that somebody must have been using it as a parcel delivery vehicle because of 2 reasons. Firstly, the vehicle was a little beat up. It has scratches on the hood from somebody dragging the charging cable across it, dents in the door jams from the driver closing the door on the seat belt buckle, and has some broken interior panels. The second reason is that unbeknownst to me at the time (I had very limited EV experience at the time) the high voltage battery was effectively cooked when I got it from the dealer and only had 90km of range. I was okay with all of this given the price of the vehicle.  I had been living in Vancouver at the time, so me and a buddy went on a short trip to Squamish to celebrate my new purchase. Going there wasn‚Äôt an issue and we charged there, but heading back we unexpectedly had a 30km range drop, and had to limp to the nearest level 2 charger as there were no level 3 stations within range. We charged it enough to get us to the next level 3 and got home after.   I took it to the Kia dealer and I had the high voltage battery replaced under warranty for free. However sadly I got the same 27.5 kWh put back in (Oh well, it was free) instead of the 30 kWh packs that some other owners reported getting put in theirs, but I was back in business with 165km range. I was super excited about the range I had just gained, so in addition to using the vehicle exclusively for commuting, but I started slowly pushing the limits of the vehicle and it‚Äôs range. I‚Äôve been really good about keeping the battery between 20-80% SOC, but I haven‚Äôt exactly been shy of straying and charging to 100% once a week or so. I started using the Torque app combined with imported data PIDS courtesy of APRP on my phone that I connected to the vehicle using an OBD2 dongle I had on hand already and started monitor vehicle status. Battery read 110% SOH at this point in the vehicle‚Äôs life.  I ended up having to move to Vancouver Island during the pandemic for a job opportunity, and I‚Äôve been doing a 66km round trip commute 5 days a week for a little over 3 years now, I end up putting about 25,000kms a year on the vehicle (It currently has about 191,000kms), and it‚Äôs been pretty good reliability wise. I had to replace the onboard charger (OBC) out of warranty for about $2000 CDN at about 170,000km, but even with a failed on board charger, I was still able to charge the vehicle at a level 3 station as it bypasses the OBC.  The vehicle had aftermarket 16‚Äù rims and new tires on it when I bought it, but I ended up damaging the tire on a pothole. The other tires were getting down to about 40%, so I opted to buy a new set of 18‚Äù rims and high performance Continental tires for it, and I installed a good set of winter tires on the old rims for winter use later that year. The 18‚Äù rims ended up cutting my range by about 25kms, but the range sacrifice was worth it in my opinion.  Not only do I love the looks of them, but the handling of the vehicle is significantly improved. Before I replaced the rims I had taken the vehicle to Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit through the company I was working for at the time and took it around the track for the afternoon, the biggest limiting factor going around corners turned out to be the tires folding under themselves when going around corners hard. It was honestly really frustrating because I could tell the car had more to give. It had a good amount of body roll, but less than you may expect given then battery placement. But ultimately it was just limited by the tires. That being said, I was actually able to pass a couple Mk7 Golf GTI‚Äôs that were running the circuit with me when we got to the corners. And yes I was very nauseous after haha  I ended up driving it from Nanaimo to Prince George late spring last year to see family along a 1,588km round trip, staying in Kamloops overnight to visit other family. I‚Äôve always known the car is more of a city commuter, not a road trip king, but I did the trip just to prove that it could do it. And it did! It however definitely struggled. The new 145km summer range meant I had to stop at 24 total DCFC stations on my entire trip, and we all know if there‚Äôs one thing EV batteries don‚Äôt like it‚Äôs constant fast charging and the heat that comes with it. I ended up learning a bunch of stuff about battery cooling on the vehicle.  I learned that there‚Äôs an air intake under both of the front seats that is sucked in my a fan located in the cargo area where the spare would normally be. That air is sucked in and is directed in between the pouch style battery cells (Didn‚Äôt know the Soul used this style of battery, all other EVs I know of use laptop style cells) to cool the battery. Cooling the battery this way was Kia‚Äôs biggest mistake. Air cooling is not sufficient to cool a battery for multiple DCFC sessions. The first couple charges aren‚Äôt too big of a deal, but by the end of the 3rd charge the battery was already above 40¬∞c. It‚Äôs at this temperature that the vehicle turns the cooling fan to max and starts dialing back the charge rate, but temps continue to climb with the charge rate being turned down and down as to not damage the EV battery.  So I came up with a partial ‚ÄúFix‚Äù, and that term really does belong in quotations. I turned the A/C to max, directed the air flow to the feet, took a couple old Glosette boxes and modified it so that the rear passenger foot vent air was directed into the battery cooling intakes. But did it work? In a word, sorta. It only was able to bring battery temps down by a couple extra degrees by the next charging station (I needed more like 10¬∞c), but it was able to keep the battery temp from rising as fast compared to before, but ultimately the same result occurred. Was it worth it and would I recommend other Soul EV owners do the same? Absolutely not. It was more of an experiment than anything to see if I could make the journey any easier. What ended up helping the most was reducing the speed at which I drove at on the freeway as to put less of a strain on the EV battery. Despite all of this, I‚Äôm glad it had the air cooling. I would imagine the same trip with similar range Leaf and it‚Äôs non-cooled battery would  probably have failed to make the trip. But that‚Äôs pure speculation.  Fast forward to today on the opposite side of things, we just experienced a cold snap and got temps as cold as -10¬∞c . While not super cold compared for much of Canada, it‚Äôs still pretty cold for us here on the island. My battery was reading as low as 0¬∞ (My apartment has an underground so it only spend 9 hours outside that day while it was parked at work) and range dipped to about 120km. It‚Äôs during this time of year that I get to use one of my favourite features, climate scheduling. I plug in at home and at work, set the timer for when I need to leave, and get into a warm and cozy car. Obviously not as fancy as those of you on here with app connected vehicles, but it‚Äôs fine given the age of the vehicle and the fact it doesn‚Äôt require a subscription leaves me quite happy.  Now at 190,000kms, it's still managed to maintain 110% SOH. I honestly have no idea how it‚Äôs gone almost 100,000kms and it's not only still above the rated comp city, it's maintained it. I‚Äôm thrilled honestly. I keep drooling at some of these new EVs, the Polestar 2 really catches my attention. But I keep driving this little Kia trouble free kilometer after trouble free kilometer and it makes me kinda love it and makes me wanna keep it. Even my partner has warmed up to it. He absolutely hated it when he first set his eyes upon it saying he hated the styling, but once he started to drive it and learn why I chose it he started to realize it was a pretty good car. Overall, I‚Äôm glad I took the risk. If I had to do it again, I definitely would. 10/10 ownership experience",2024-01-20 05:48:47,8,0,electriccars
Experienced the Ups and Downs of EV/Rivian Ownership today,"Bad news: I drove 20 miles to an EVGO charger today and when I arrived, I found it broken. I stood in the torrential rain while I troubleshot it with the EV Go support tech. Eventually we got it working and I went shopping. After 15 minutes and a tornado warning the charge failed again. I left with less mileage than I started with in the storm.   Redeeming good news: I ran into 3 road washouts on my way home. Each one had at least 1 flooded car in it with water up to their windows.  I threw Vivian the Rivian into Off Road Highest mode and drove right through while all the doubters looked on in awe. It totally made up for my wet clothes. :) I also said Hi to a turtle that crossed my path and then let him back on his way.",2023-08-08 18:20:34,203,84,Rivian

The Surprising Truth About EV Ownership and Reliability,,2024-01-23 16:07:58,1,2,electriccars
Thoughts on EV ownership?,I'm considering getting a new cheap EV but I'm concerned about a few things:  - is it convenient to get it when not owning a charging wallbox? Meaning is there sufficient infrastructure in Lux in general to manage with public charging stations?  - is the range sufficient for medium length rides say going to Brussels or Frankfurt?  Btw I'm considering the Kona or Fiat 500e but if you have any other recommendations within that price range it would be great to know :)  Cheers!,2022-01-18 00:03:42,9,41,Luxembourg

At What Point would you Switch to an EV? The math of potential EV ownership in Quebec,"I have a Mitsubishi Mirage, which I don't care what anyone says, has been a reliable, incredibly efficient workhorse. This math only really works because the price of gas has gone bananas, and on average, I don't really think it's going back down.  So I'm considering a move to Quebec, the province of Canada with not only the cheapest electricity, but also the countries leading electric car rebates at 12000 CAD.   This brings down the cost of a Hyundai Ionic 5 for example From 56000 CAD to 44000 CAD tax in. If I really wanted to be barebones with cost, the Chevy Bolt would be 39000, but I'm going to use the Ioniq for my illustrations.     In comparison, this is obviously still much more expensive than a CVT Mirage, but when you start doing the math, it becomes surprisingly compelling.     According to the Quebec electric vehicles page, the average cost of charging a vehicle in Quebec costs around 200-300 CAD for 20000 km, and this is 97% clean energy. Considering where I'm moving, this would probably be closer to the 200 CAD. [https://vehiculeselectriques.gouv.qc...isation-ve.asp](https://vehiculeselectriques.gouv.qc.ca/english/decouvrir/cout-utilisation-ve.asp)     If I do the math on my Mirage(which frankly isn't equivalent to either in features, fit and finish) at an average fuel consumption of 5.5 L/100 km(which frankly is generous at this point) and assuming the average fuel cost remains around $2/L, that's a cost of 2200 CAD per 20000 km, a difference of around 2000 per 20000 km. And that fuel consumption would be much higher in something in the size of the Ioniq 5. Assuming the car lasts for at least the 200000 km range (which would probably be higher since there are so few moving parts), that is 22000 CAD in fuel consumption. and that's assuming fuel doesn't get *more* expensive.     If we do the math for an average new cross over which (on paper) consumes around 7.8 L/100 km in fuel, we're looking at a savings of 3120 per 20000 km, or 31200 over 200000 km. Less electricity cost, which in Quebec are incredibly stable considering the oversupply of hydro dams, that is a 20000 CAD savings over the Mirage, and a 29200 CAD savings to an equivalent vehicle to the Ioniq 5.     **Not considering other maintenance costs at this point, if we factor in the cost of fuel over 200000 km, the vehicle would cost 24000 in total in comparison to the Mirage, and for an equivalent vehicle it would be 14800 CAD. At 15 K That's literally less than a brand new Mirage at this point. And the car would last longer more than 200000 km.**     Add to this soon I will have to get a new car anyway as my Mirage is at 220000 km, and as much as I like it, I don't think she's lasting another 200000 km. And add to this new Mirages are stupidly expensive for what they offer, and the Mirage's used price is also inflated to probably 5-6000 CAD right now, benefitting me if I wanted to sell. And add to this the EV use case might actually be more compelling for me as I was considering doing Uber or doordash until my grasp of French was good enough to do otherwise.     **I was really figuring my next vehicle was going to be a Ford Maverick since the functionality was so impressive, but when factoring in Fuel, Electric cars, especially in Quebec, are surprisingly cheap. What do you guys think? And it's much better for the environment to boot. So what do you think? When would you switch?**",2022-06-25 01:17:23,1,70,PersonalFinanceCanada
"My review of First EV ownership coming from a car guy at heart, but using as a daily driver","2018 Model 3 Dual motor Long range - Added Ghost upgrade for performance software  I will likely get flamed, please feel free to downvote, no hard feelings here, just the facts that i personally observed so far.  Owned many cars as my weekend warrior and daily driver. Im a loyal Toyota fan and have owned many of different generation Camrys. Loved my 07 335i BMW with 700 hp on a set of twin turbos, but boy was I happy to see it go when I was sick of the maintenance and stress of breaking things on it.  I was close to buying a 340I but at the end of the day, I just couldn‚Äôt find any for the price I picked up my dual motor model 3 (now with Ghost upgrade performance software).  **Pros:**  **Styling** ‚Äì Subjective but I like the styling, although its certainly not my favorite, but its pretty good.  **Powertrain** ‚Äì Powertrain is great, wish other car manufacturers sold more electric vehicles because this isn‚Äôt exclusive to tesla, electric is just great for daily driving and instant power.  **App** ‚Äì App is a nice feature, although not exclusive to tesla as many other manufacturers have this as well.  **Heat/AC** ‚Äì The heat and AC is able to be used while the car is in the garage waiting to be driven, this is a nice feature but hardly one I use because I just deal with it and save money on not preheating (never pre heated my gas cars either)  **MPG** ‚Äì Less money to ‚Äúfill up‚Äù per charge so that‚Äôs a plus  Im really struggling to find much here that I like about the car, although I don‚Äôt hate the car but it hasn‚Äôt won me over yet to EV‚Äôs, I may very well get gas in the future. I truly do like the car over all, but this write up has me questioning why I like it as much as I do, and why I may be deceiving myself and not really enjoying it as much as I thought.  \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  &#x200B;  **Cons:**  **Range** ‚Äì 140 - 240 miles on a full charge, usually closer to 140 miles for utilizing 100% of battery pack (ideally charge to 80, drain no less than 20%) So about 100 miles of useable range the way I personally drive. Compared to 300 ‚Äì 400 miles in my 2020 Camry.  **Quality, fit/finish** ‚Äì Not terrible, its sufficient, similar to a Chevy or Ford IMO. Not as good as a European or Toyota/Honda. I needed to add extra window seals to seal off the windows which kept making a buffeting noise at higher speeds, drove my crazy.  **Lack of Key Fob** ‚Äì Phone is about 75% consistent as a key, making me wait many seconds otherwise to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù in order to drive. Key card is not user friendly and lacks buttons for the frunk unlock/lock which I use regularly. Not having a physical l key slot for any time the vehicle battery dies or something glitches or have phone that acts up and I don‚Äôt have key card etc. very much concerns me.  **Power** ‚Äì Great down low, but specifically top end past 70-80mph on the freeway its an average sports car level and cant compete with other cars that are similar in power on the low end (just venting here, power is sufficient really but depressing as the speed increases and battery drains, and temperature drops)  **Noise** ‚Äì This car is very loud, not just noise level, but frequencies are harsh. My ears are sensitive these days unfortunately, so I take heed to this more than the average person so take it with a grain of salt.  **Ride comfort** ‚Äì Noise level here, is higher than average but the suspension is also very stiff and unforgiving. As explained earlier, I had a bad wind noise/buffeting at higher speeds in which I needed to add aftermarket seals for. Not a fun time.  **Lack of physical buttons** ‚Äì Design is a little to simplistic. I would like a physical lock/unlock button and heated seats button, especially for the back seats etc.  **Charging** ‚Äì Charging is more of a pain than gas stations. That‚Äôs the way I feel about it at least. Gas fill up is once a week at most, few minutes time. EV you need to install a charger, takes way longer and i need to step over the cable and unplug in the mornings i charge (most days) etc. just an inconvenience on the average day.  **Maintenance** ‚Äì This is a double edged sword. Tesla Is expensive when things do go wrong, which they can and likely will at some point. Electronic parts and modules break and ive heard the horror stories. No oil changes is great, burning through tires faster, not so much. Although the maintenance is generally good on these cars, maybe not as good or cheap or easy (to find a shop to work on it) as a Toyota but close.  **Other gripes:**     Driver door does not close all the way in a lot of cases (on level ground) needing a re shutting. My Camry would close all the way even on the slightest close of door. Doors sound cheap when closing. Frameless windows are cheaper less ideal option than framed windows, less seal and more noise will inevitably come through, including possible wind buffeting issues long term. The door handle gets frozen (flush) in winter, another thing I don't have to worry about in most cars. Insurance is NOT cheap compared to other daily drivers in this class of car, negates gas savings for me   &#x200B;  **Neutral -**  Handling - The car rockets out of corners, nothing can compete if its not AWD and electric. Suspension is stiff, battery pack is low so the center of gravity is great being so low in corners. Mechanical grip is actually pretty good, although not amazing. Brakes are terrible, literally worse than my 2020 Camry, a famous Nuremburg driver tracked one and he said the brakes were among the worst he's ever experienced. Chassis IMO isnt confidence inspiring, Traction control and stability is extremely intrusive without the ability to turn it off. and the car seems to wander a slight bit at higher speeds even with a fresh alignment. Other cars ive owned have felt better/more stable at high speeds in the same or lower class of vehicle. Although the tesla doesn't feel terrible, it feels less refined, as most vehicles on the road today, really not surprising to me as Tesla hasn't been around for decades.",2023-11-20 23:42:04,0,57,TeslaModel3

What are you looking to spend?

Thoughts on Tesla/EV Ownership Before and After a Hurricane,"I'm located in southwest Broward county in South Florida (Fort Lauderdale area), close to where civilization meets the Florida Everglades.  In my area, there were many that lost power during the storm and still do not have power several days later.  Before the storm, having an EV is without a doubt much better than a gas car.  Several days before the storm arrived, very long lines formed at gas stations and some waited for a very long time to get gas.  I cruised right by, went home, plugged right in, and was charged up ready to go the next day.  I didn't even move the car for several days until after the storm, because everything was still closed.  There was no reason to go anywhere.  By the time stores started opening, roadways were cleared, and power was restored to some areas, there were plenty of options to trickle charge at friends, charge at other EV owner's homes, shopping centers, etc.  After the storm, it was very much the same as before the storm.  Many gas stations did not have power but had gas.  Others had power but had no gas.  The short supply caused long lines at the very few operational gas stations.  I think in many (perhaps most) ways, it's actually better to own an EV when a natural disaster strikes.  With ICE vehicles, fuel supply is disrupted and it becomes difficult to refuel.  If you're fortunate enough not to lose power for an extended period, you'll have transport and will only have to deal with other motorist challenges (debris blocking roadways, nonoperational traffic lights, etc.).  If you do lose power for an extended period, you will find other options and others willing to help.",2017-09-13 13:05:06,95,130,teslamotors

18 months of EV ownership in Australia: real world results,"I posted a version of this in r/carsaustralia but thought it might also be of interest here.   We bought a Tesla Model 3 SR+ in May 2021. I‚Äôd driven one a few months earlier as I wasn‚Äôt keen on EVs but wanted to see for myself. I‚Äôm a car guy first and foremost but with an environmental conscience; I just liked ICE engines and manual transmissions. Totally changed my mind. Couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how good it was afterwards, so we decided to replace my wife‚Äôs car with one.  At the time, government policy at a national level was not supportive of EVs but more supportive at a state level. Since then there‚Äôs been a change of government nationally and there‚Äôs more support for EV buying and infrastructure.  Our use case is well suited to EV ownership. The extreme cold issues are not applicable to us in the way they seem to affect people in the US. We live in a colder part of Australia but it‚Äôs rarely below -5C. We have easy access to charging at home, and have rooftop solar panels, so in effect if the car is home a lot during the day (and it is), then we are recharging it from a clean power source for free. We also don‚Äôt tow anything, so concerns about range dropping in those circumstances are irrelevant to us.  We had expected to only use it as a suburban car, and use our ICE family car for the longer trip we take every month or two (about 300km each way). However, rising fuel costs and the fact that the Model 3 is a really nice road trip car now means that we use it for those trips too. 300km at freeway speeds is well within the car‚Äôs capabilities so we only stop to recharge if we didn‚Äôt leave home fully charged. I estimate it could do 350km at those speeds but haven‚Äôt pushed it that far.  In the time we‚Äôve had it, fast charging locations on that trip have increased from two to four, so the convenience has improved significantly. Having said that, our regular trip is along Australia‚Äôs major east coast route where you‚Äôd expect to find the best infrastructure.   I know people object to needing to stop every few hours to charge on a longer road trip. We haven‚Äôt done a longer trip than 300km or so in this car. Personally I don‚Äôt like to drive more than 2-3 hours at a time for fatigue management reasons, plus TBH I usually need to pee by then and/or want food or coffee, so it would make little difference to my progress on a longer trip.  The thing about charging - and I misunderstood this too before getting an EV - is that you need to change your mindset. You don‚Äôt refuel when it‚Äôs nearly empty, you plug it in whenever you‚Äôre not using it. ABC: Always Be Charging. That way you easily top up the 20-100km you might do on a typical day.  Running costs have been super low. Aside from most of our recharging being free, we‚Äôve spent no money on servicing beyond a tyre rotation, and haven‚Äôt needed tyres yet at nearly 50,000km. We‚Äôve had no faults whatsoever and no build quality concerns (noting our Tesla was Shanghai rather than Fremont built).   And I genuinely enjoy how it drives - it‚Äôs fast, responsive, smooth, and quiet. Perfect daily.  For us, there have been no downsides. However, as things stand an EV probably won‚Äôt work well for you if: - you can‚Äôt afford an expensive new car, because the upfront cost is substantial (albeit improving) and Australia doesn‚Äôt subsidise purchasing like other places do; - you can‚Äôt charge at home/work; - you need to tow regularly; - you travel long distances through areas poorly served by fast chargers; or - you really do need to drive 4+ hours at a time without stopping.  Oh, there is one downside: getting into lots of discussions with people about EVs. Fine when they are genuinely interested; annoying if they just want to regurgitate anti-EV talking points that have been disproven repeatedly.  We still run two ICE cars, one being my daily. That will likely be replaced with an EV when the time comes. The other - being a manual V8 - will get rolled out on weekends and so on as time goes on.  Hope that‚Äôs been of interest. For us, it‚Äôs been an absolute win.",2022-12-28 17:51:10,73,22,electricvehicles
My first EV ownership experience :(,"Dude I was in the same boat today.  Purchased a 2023 Niro EV 3 days ago.  It was amazing and loved it.  But then reality strikes, and yesterday the check EV system warning came on.  My car had 160 miles on it.  It was Cityscape Green, the perfect color for me.  It drives fine but I really don't want to chance it.  I drove a rust bucket ICE for 16 years and I was fine.  But now I have a family I am not going to chance anything.  I took it to the dealer.  No one knows what is wrong with it.  They said this car is too new.  Everyone is in uncharted territory.  And they didn't even have the lift to properly raise the car to check on the battery.  They sent me to another dealership with the proper lift claiming they can properly help me and give me a loaner.  Went to the other dealership.  They laugh and said they don't have any loaners at all.  And the mentioned the idea of buyback.  So I called the original dealer where I purchased the car and mentioned what the technician in second dealership said.    Original dealership got nervous and tells me to come back.  He will provide me with a loaner car.  Went back, he gave me the two choices, take the loaner and let them try to fix my Niro EV.  Or swap out my tag with another Niro EV in the lot, an orange one.    After much deliberation, and a long discussion with the wife on the phone.  I ended up picking the orange Niro EV.  I basically redid all the paperwork and they just gave me another car and kept my green baby.   : ( I hope the orange guy don't fail me. This is my first experience with EV.  I love the tech and the driving experience.  But I hate the fact that my anti-EV anti Korean-made car in-laws got a told-you-so moment.",2023-02-08 06:12:53,10,14,KiaNiroEV

Consumer Reports: Increasing Number of Americans Express Interest in EV Ownership,,2022-07-07 22:40:15,90,28,teslainvestorsclub
The Real Cost of EV Ownership: Myths and Savings,"   # 1. Purchase Price vs. Total Cost:  * AAA estimates that the average annual cost of owning a new gasoline-powered vehicle in the United States is around $9,282, including fuel, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation. * The Edison Electric Institute reports that electric vehicle owners in the United States can save an average of $770 per year in fuel costs compared to driving a gasoline-powered car.  # 2. Charging Costs:  * According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the cost of charging an electric vehicle at home in the United States averages about 13 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The average electric vehicle uses about 24 kWh to travel 100 miles, resulting in a cost of approximately $3.12 per 100 miles.  # 3. Maintenance and Repairs:  * Consumer Reports indicates that electric vehicles generally have lower maintenance costs in the United States, with an average annual maintenance expense of around $500, compared to an average of $1,000 or more for gasoline-powered cars.  # 4. Government Incentives:  * In the United States, federal tax credits for electric vehicles are available, with credits ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 based on the vehicle's battery capacity. State-level incentives can further reduce the cost of EV ownership.  # 5. Resale Value:  * Kelley Blue Book found that the Tesla Model 3 retained 69.3% of its value after three years and 48,684 miles, which is notably higher than many gasoline-powered vehicles.  # 6. Environmental Benefits:  * The Union of Concerned Scientists reports that electric vehicles in the United States produce approximately 60% less greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime compared to the average new gasoline-powered vehicle.  \*\*\*\*These specific statistics are estimated and might not be updated and they represent EV ownership in the United States in this specific context\*\*\*\*  Feel free to discuss your real life ownerships and share your experience, thanks.",2023-09-26 19:42:58,1,0,ev_hub

One Year Ownership Update - 2023 Bolt EV 1LT,"Figured I'd give a one year update on ownership for our 2023 Bolt EV 1LT.  A few bits of context for this car's situation; we're located in Southern California, so low temperatures aren't really a thing, and we've used the heater maybe a dozen times, mostly just in the past two weeks. We also charge almost exclusively at home; we've used $120 of our $500 EVgo credits, with $70 of those being from the single road trip we took in the car last year, which I'll detail some other time. The car currently has 11.5k miles on it; we average just under 1000 miles a month. It's our primary vehicle; we're practically a one-car family due to my work being 99% WFH and my wife's job being 2 miles down the street. Our other vehicle is an 11MPG gas-guzzling beast of an offroader, so we only use it for adventures; that vehicle only saw 3k miles last year.  # Photos:  Check out my previous thread from last year for photos:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/109m0aw/economy\_box\_to\_hot\_hatch\_a\_tint\_and\_powder\_coated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/109m0aw/economy_box_to_hot_hatch_a_tint_and_powder_coated/)  # Purchase Price:  We paid exactly $30k including tax, for our 2023 Bolt EV on Jan 1 of last year. Haven't done our taxes yet, but we should recieve the full $7500 federal credit when we file. The purchase story can be read on a previous post, here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/100fqbh/happy\_hunger\_games\_may\_the\_odds\_be\_ever\_in\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/100fqbh/happy_hunger_games_may_the_odds_be_ever_in_your/)  # Efficiency:  Last year, we averaged 3.9 mi/kWh, according to the car's infotainment center. Most of our driving is around town, with monthly trips down to San Diego from Orange County, and occasional trips close enough for us to drive to our destination and back on a single 100% charge; the furthest being 254 mile trip to Santa Barbara and back. My wife takes it pretty easy, but I've got something of a lead foot and like to rip around town; it's been a year, and I still enjoy the zippy acceleration and flinging the car into corners.  # Tires:  The stock tires, in my opinion, SUCKED. They got fantastic range, but that's about it. The car had them on for the first 10.7k miles of it's life, and they squealed like crazy at the slightest hint of trying to have fun, were terrible in the rain, and ultimately wore down really fast. By the time I rotated them at the 10.7k mark (I had meant to do it at 10k, but didn't have time before we left on a trip), the front tires were \~3-4/32"", and needed replacing soon. I also found a shard of metal in one of the rear tires, so I decided to just bite the bullet and replace them all. I got Michelin Pilot Sport All-Season 4's, and the difference has been absolutely night and day in terms of performance. Yes, there has been an efficiency hit, we've averaged 3.3 mi/kWh for the last 800 miles, so a \~16% decrease in range. But anything other than laying on the throttle from a dead stop with the wheel turned, and the car sticks to the road with no wheel spin; not to mention stopping distance, which by my tests is around 60-0 in \~100ft. The Bolt used to be fun to drive; it's now almost hilarious to drive. Most importantly, we can still do an Orange County to San Diego trip in a single 100% charge without needing to top the battery off, which is the only real long-distance driving we do in this car.  # Charging:  We got a Grizzl-E charger, and hooked it in to a 50A circuit in the garage. It meant unplugging our jacuzzi, which was a bummer, but we use the car a lot more, and it's saved us a ton in gas money, so it's ended up being worth it. We just charge to 80% every night, as we drive around town 90% of the time, and don't need a full battery. We'll charge to 100% the night before driving to San Diego or taking a longer trip. We've never used a charger that isn't in the EVgo network, as we figure, we have the credits, why not use them? In total, we've only charged away from home a handful of times.  # Mods:  We've more or less left the car stock; the entire point of this thing was for it to not cost a lot of money, which is why we got the 1LT with as few additions as possible. I coated the wheels and got a 20% tint right out of the gate, and also swapped the rearview mirror with one from a Subaru Outback that had auto-dimming and HomeLink buttons. The only other thing I did was add front and rear dashcams. Otherwise, the car is bone stock.  # Things We Like:  * The color continues to draw a smile from my wife and I; it was 1000% the right call for this car, and we both still love it. Getting the wheels coated and windows tinted adds to the vehicle's aesthetic significantly, and works beautifully with the blue. * Wireless Android Auto (we don't have any iPhones, but I'm sure wireless Carplay is also great) is FANTASTIC. It works every single time, and I've never had any issues with it. * Similarly, the infotainment display is beautiful. It's high-res, a great size, and ups the interior feel of the car significantly. * It's so quiet! Don't get me wrong, I love a good engine noise, and my offroader's V8 with dual glasspacks sounds exquisite. But I really think that I might prefer silence. You can legit have a conversation on the freeway without raising your voice. * It's a lot of fun to drive. It has no right being so fun for how inexpensive and economical it is; a similarly-optioned ICE vehicle would have a pair of anemic hamsters running around in the engine bay. If this is the cheapest of the cheap for current-gen EV's, it can only get better from here. * There's plenty of room in the back for car seats, and the rear doors have a great shape for getting a kid in and out. * The automatic high beams work great. I think I can count on one hand the amount of times they've accidently blasted someone.  # Things We Don't Like:  * The MURDER TRIANGLES on the rear hatch. The first few months of owning the car, I slammed my head more times than I care to admit, and the first time my dad got something out of the back, he split his eyebrow open pretty badly and almost had to get stitches. * The DC fast charging speed is pretty terrible. I'll chalk this up to a negligible negative, as we really don't ever use DC fast charging, we knew it was a factor before buying the car, and not having faster charging also helped keep the cost of the vehicle low; Chevy had to cut corners somewhere. For others, I definitely understand it being a bigger deal; our next EV will definitely be something with 250+kW charging. * The Infortainment screen is a fingerprint MAGNET. I keep a microfiber cloth in the center console just to wipe it down every time I get in. * There's nowhere to put sunglasses. * The cupholders are pretty small, and don't fit a lot of bottles. * There's a rattle/squeak that occasionally comes from the front driver's corner of the dashboard, and I've never been able to figure out exactly how to prevent it. * If the windows are rolled down on a nice day, the b-pillar is close enough to the front of the vehicle that I can't rest my arm on the open window sill. * The speakers are just okay. * The MyChevy app is completely atrocious, and I really only used it the first month or two of owning the car. I just got asked by ther car to re-enter my password, and I couldn't even remeber what it was because it had been so long since I'd logged on. * The car had two defects we had warrantied. Number one was the windshield washer fluid pump; it stopped working around month 5 of owning the vehicle, and we had to have it replaced by Chevy. Number two was one of the tail lamps; it would get standing water in it after it rained, but not after washing it. This was a problem immediately after buying the car, and we had Chevy replace the entire enclosure. * The heater takes quite a while to spit out any heat. It's also extremely inefficient, but since we're never driving far, that's never been an issue. * When the car is locked, and you open only the hatch, and then close it without opening any of the other doors, when the car locks, 50% of the time the alarm will also sound. I've never figured out how to stop this from happening.  # Other Thoughts:  * We've only experienced the ""Conditions Not Right For Shift"" error once, and it happened when my wife jumped in the car and hit the Engine Start and Reverse buttons at practically the exact same time. Turning the car off and walking to the neighbor's house and back solved the problem. Still sucks that it's a thing that can happen, but we haven't had any other encounters with it.",2024-01-17 23:34:05,24,14,BoltEV
Three Month Ownership Update - ICE vs EV costs,"Hi Ioniq5!  I had a life changing career opportunity come up in July, which equated to inhering a 51mi, 1.5hr one way commute in Los Angeles, vs. my old WFH job. Needless to say I took the gig and after a month or so with a 2016 manual WRX I decided to make the jump to an EV.  Picked up a 2023 Ioniq5 Limited in AWD as the replacement for the WRX and started gathering data immediately.  The cost to fill my WRX fluctuated between $75 and $85 dollars, and I was filling up once weekly with the new commute, which is only two days a week.  That plus my normal driving to and from used up almost the whole 15.9gal tank regularly.  I started keeping a spreadsheet on my first charge, and the car currently has 4,526 miles on the odometer. I have ONLY ever charged at EA stations, so every single kWh of charging has been free thus far.  Here's a breakdown on the charges and incurred costs, the EA stations in my area are $0.48/kWh so the kWh delivered estimate is just the total cost / .48:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/6gys2mmnt52c1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f7e48a6241b51743fe8633a9cc7a29bbc4b626e  Mileage wise, this would have been pretty close to $1500 bucks in gas based on this commute.  I do have a car payment now, which I didn't before, but the cost savings alone in this department almost make up for it.  The HDA2 doing most of the heavy lifting during the commute also lessens the driving fatigue immensely, which is a really nice bonus.  Overall I'm very happy with the purchase, I've not had any real issues with the car, my trim is still black, there's one wrinkle in the leather seat which is fine, consider it patina, no charging issues, etc.  It's been super comfy, peppy enough to still have some fun, and overall a great experience.  Thought some folks may want to see real world numbers from an I5, and being that today is Thanksgiving in the US, I'm thankful for not having to pay a cent for charging thus far!",2023-11-23 20:53:11,23,21,Ioniq5

Ownership review of my 2024 MG ZS EV Executive Variant,"An ownership review of my white MG ZS EV (Executive), which I bought last month for 19.06L (On Road-Delhi).

Newly ordered Rivians probably aren't coming until 2024, Tesla's are out until late 2022 depending on how you spec them, Mach E's are hard to get, F150s have no real ETA for deliveries.  On top of that, if you buy a car from a traditional dealership markups are insane right now!  Let's start a thread about which cars are available (new) without much of a wait or markup. Specifically I ask this because I am going to be donating my car to my Mother-in-Law, and I don't have the option to go without a car for 6+ months.

My 22222 km ownership review of the Tata Nexon EV XZ+,"&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bq4y9og1c0ba1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=237131e1159fac38a6faeb92f5406b013a38a38c  Hey everyone. I have recently finished 22222 kms on my 2021 October Nexon EV. Here are a few thoughts:  **LIKES**  1. Amazing refinement. Lack of sound and vibration make journeys much more relaxing. 2. The suspension is unparalleled. The Nexon feels solid on poor roads and gobbles them up just as easily. The 215mm ground clearance really helps. 3. Sub 4 meter size makes parking easy. 4. Sofa-like seats are extremely comfortable. 5. The front looks great. 6. If you drive smartly while using Level 3 Regen, you hardly need to apply the brakes at all. 7. Low fuel cost. Around 2 rupees per kilometre. Not 1 rupee as claimed. But still good. 8. Took advantage of the 2.5 lakh rupees subsidy in Maharashtra. Ended up getting the car for 14.2 lacs instead of 16.7 lacs. 9. Exhilarating performance in S mode. Drains the battery though. 10. Speakers are better than I expected them to be. 11. Steering feels really nice to hold. 12. Placement of the boot release switch is very convenient.  &#x200B;  **Dislikes**  1. There needs to be a remote fuel cap open switch. The number of times I have tried putting it on charge only to realise I have not opened the fuel lid. 2. The infotainment system feels dated. 3. The regen automatically switches to level 1 every time you switch off the car. You have to switch it back to whatever level you prefer every time you start driving. 4. No auto headlamp off. The lights stay on even after you have turned off and locked the car. 5. In my opinion, the rear does not look great. 6. The range could be higher. Usually get around 175-180 kms per charge. 7. Charging time of around 10% per hour feels really slow. 8. The placement of USB socket in the front is difficult to reach. 9. The kilometre range is misleading. Rely on battery percentage only and not the range displayed. 10. The electronic shifter is slow to respond. 11. Paid connected features. The app is glitchy. 12. Non adjustable rear headrests make it uncomfortable for tall passengers.  &#x200B;  **Alternatives considered when buying the car**  Wanted to purchase an EV only, so the options were limited to the Nexon, MG ZS, and Hyundai Kona.  Kona - The rear seat space was poor. The MG ZS just felt like an overall better package for a similar price point.  ZS EV - Had actually booked this before the Nexon. Cancelled my booking when a friend pointed out that even with 300km of range, the ZS really cannot be used for super long distances and is best for city use. That coupled with the fact that I was paying almost 10 lacs less, swayed the decision in Nexon's favour.  &#x200B;  **Purchase experience**  Purchased the vehicle from Punit Motors, Worli, Mumbai. Would not recommend. Even though everything went down smoothly at the end, the uncertainty and lack of responsibility from the dealership was astounding.  &#x200B;  Opted for the XZ+ variant as the full subsidy was not available on the XZ+ Lux variant. The differences between the models did not warrant the price. (Leather seats, auto headlamps, auto wipers, sunroof)  &#x200B;  Attaching the extended warranty price list and covered items below. I always recommend buying extended warranty for peace of mind.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zwojez8h71ba1.jpg?width=1141&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13849adc853ae24a721720d060188fff739037ad  https://preview.redd.it/c8d3019h71ba1.jpg?width=1032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c16dfba7eeb4e904656e13fede56db117729310b  The car comes with 2 airbags and a 50:50 weight ratio. The rear brakes are drum which is disappointing. The brakes work fine in normal usage, but if you have to brake hard suddenly after some acceleration, they do not do a good job at all.  &#x200B;  My usage varies across city, highways and off roads. I make frequent trips to Lonavala. The car usually covers 95kms to Lonavala with 35% SOC left. It returns with around 40-45% SOC left. The difference is due to the uphill climb on the way to Lonavala. It feels comfortable on all road types. Tata has done a stellar job with the suspension.  Big fan of the front design of the car, not so much of the back. The wheels look great.  https://preview.redd.it/8lwl4k5581ba1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcce7259b557fa3223897a003e5292bb25323c90  https://preview.redd.it/2f99cq5581ba1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cebb6b9be14c74ad007f7f1666e214ab8924890f  [215\/60 R16 gives a decent cushion to make the ride softer](https://preview.redd.it/3gg2mm5581ba1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a86541acbdc568884667f9c7f30b664b647b857b)  Decent space in the boot of weekend trips away.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/906de3wa81ba1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c66e1c93544dc7714394bf06d64dcf32d8aa9e2  On normal driving, one can expect efficiency of 160-200 wh/km which translates to 150-200 km of range on a 30kwh battery.  &#x200B;  Recently, I drove from 100% SOC to single digits in a day, The car goes to limp mode under 10-11%. It does not go above 50kmph and the ac reduces its efficiency. This is to get the maximum out of your battery and make you reach your destination without getting stranded.  Once under 25% SOC you cannot activate Sport Mode.  &#x200B;  The car is due a service at 22500 km . I have got two services already at 7500km and 15000km. First one cost me around 1600 and the second one around 2200.  &#x200B;  **Niggles and issues**  1. The charging gun actuator failed once causing the gun to be stuck to the charging plug in the car. The fault was rectified immediately by TML and the actuator was replaced. 2. The boot lock stopped working. Apparently, this is a manufacturing defect across all Nexon models and was also replaced immediately by TML. 3. Sometimes during heavy rain, the charger shows earthing fault. That was rectified by the workshop as well. 4. The clip of the headboard behind the rear passenger broke easily. Have to still get that replaced.  &#x200B;  **Verdict**  The Tata Nexon EV is the perfect car for those have constant short runs outside city and for urban commute. If you are looking for a car that can tackle any road, is economical to run and your usage does not include travelling long distances in one go, then you cannot go wrong with it.  &#x200B;  Feel free to ask any questions.",2023-01-09 16:01:41,79,39,CarsIndia

EV car ownership -- still not worth it even with gas prices soaring?,"hi all, with gas being so expensive and SD being so prime for solar recharging, I was looking into used EVs. but no matter how I look at it it seems that there's a good $10-20K difference between low-end gas vs EV cars, and when talking about Tesla's the models are even more overpriced in the S and X ranges ($20-50k over a competitive gas powered machine). with SDGE lowest tier pricing,  it seems even if you save $200 a month on gas, it would take you 5-10 years to break even but that's not counting insurance (which would be higher because of more expensive vehicle). plus no guarantee that SDGE won't decide to raise lowest teir pricing randomly. (one could argue gas prices are less volatile than SDGE!)   so EV owners, did you buy used and how did you convince yourself to switch? did  you take a financial loss?",2022-07-13 03:42:53,4,92,sandiego

Advice/Learnings for EV Ownership in Western Canada CCS/Tesla,"VW iD4 reservation holder here; I just wanted to add some input for anyone considering an ID4 in Western Canada.  I recently took delivery of a 2022 Tesla model 3 and my initial plan was to keep the tesla until my ID4 arrives. Given my real world winter results I think I may keep the Tesla as a road trip vehicle and use the ID4 as an intown vehicle only.  \-I have taken the tesla on 3 separate road trips of 1000km+ in Alberta and have noticed that CCS fast chargers (mostly flo stations) are more prevalent than Tesla Superchargers. The CCS chargers are in almost every city with 20,000+ populations vs the Tesla Super chargers only being in major centers.  which I have CCS to tesla adapter so I can charge up at either right now. The major problem with the CCS chargers are that 95% of them are 50kW vs the Tesla ones which are mostly 250kW with some 150kW (my model 3 can take 170kW peak).  \-On a drive from Edmonton to Lethbridge (550km) I charged for 13 mins in red deer and 14 mins in north calgary with charge speeds of 120-150kW using Tesla superchargers. If I was in an ID4 the charge time would have been 3x as long so probably an hour and half of charging for a 5.5 hour drive.  \-On top of this the winter range of my tesla in -25C is roughly 280km down from the rated 430km (35% loss) so I needed to charge a lot during cold weather events.   \-The battery preconditioning on the Tesla seems to work great as I pull 100kW plus in cold temps. The software is amazing for navigation on this car. The range estimator takes into account, wind speed, weather, driving habits, etc. It is really nice have a number you can trust in regards to % of battery once you arrive.   \-RWD with winter tires on an EV is amazing. With 50/50 weight distribution and advance traction control my tesla is equivalent or better than an FWD with winters. Only limiting factor is ground clearance   &#x200B;  In my opinion the only way the ID4 will be a viable road trip vehicle in this region is if:  1.Tesla opens chargers to CCS cars or flo and other 3rd parties retrofit their level 3 chargers to 150kW stations  2.VW brings back the heatpump into production and adds preconditioning. Preconditioning is more important IMO     I hope 2 happens by the time I take my order (probably 2024 at this rate lol). I am really skeptical that tesla will open up chargers though. Given this, For two vehicle households I would recommend getting a base ID4 and using it as the intown car with an ice or tesla for roadtrips.   &#x200B;  Hope this helps!",2023-02-09 16:33:04,1,1,VWiD4Owners

Parking pad dispute spurs questions over Toronto‚Äôs electric vehicle charging plan,"David Jankovic saw the amount of parking pads built by neighbours and decided to install one of his own. Unfortunately, he said he wasn‚Äôt aware a permit was required first and a complaint led to him seeking approval after the fact. He sought approval of his neighbours who responded positively in a vote, but several spoiled ballots were counted as votes against his efforts.  For now, Jankovic is looking at his options for appealing the decision made at community council, where he said he was open to installing bricks that are porous and allow more water absorption from rain. But without a charging station of his own, he said the reality of being able to move away from gasoline on his next vehicle doesn‚Äôt seem attainable.",2024-03-17 21:14:18,0,38,toronto

I know nothing about Electric Vehicle maintenance and just inherited a 2022 Nissan Leaf. Could use some advice!,"It's already been sitting around for about 3 months. It was Grandma's favorite thing, she was always very attached to her car, whatever it was. She got her first car in 1953 when she was 16 - unheard of back then, and shortly after she traded that in for a Racing Green MGB. She was a rad chick. I am not as cool as she was and I am likely going to sell it (sorry Grandma), or trade it + my current car (2013 Subaru Crosstrek) for something real nice. I do want to make sure it is in good condition when I do that.  Charging it isn't a problem, Grandma was my neighbor, and she had the hookup hooked up to the garage between our two homes, so the car doesn't even need to move. I know that gas cars are all filled with various fluids that need to not sit around for too long or they get less fluid-y, I imagine something similar is going on in this thing but I have no idea. I'm not now, nor have I ever really been a car guy, but I do have a handle on the basics and slightly beyond. I can change my own oil and even brake pads, flex emoji.  Are these engines lubricated? Do I need to pay attention to that? I'm not leaving it plugged in but I have charged it overnight a few times since it's been stagnant. It's safe from the elements in a garage, and I'm keeping an eye on tire pressure. Should I drive it around every now and then?   Any advice is appreciated.

Vehicle Maintenance: A Few Tips to Save You Money,"Hey fellow PFCers, I hope you all had a great holiday weekend.   I'm a Vehicle Technician here in good ole New Brunswick, and if there's one thing that I've noticed this year compared to the last few years, is the rising cost of vehicle repairs. Even here in New Brunswick, where shop rates are generally low compared to the rest of the country, I've seen shop rates shoot up by up to 50%. Vehicle parts, and this includes used parts from the auto salvage yards, I've seen prices double, even triple in some cases. The cost of vehicle maintenance/repairs is hitting everyone pretty hard these days, and many people choose to just abandon their vehicles altogether rather then fix them. Time are tough, and while there's not much we can do about rising prices, there are a few things you can do to reduce how often your vehicle ends up in the shop for repairs - in the form of preventative maintenance.  First, and most common (and pricey) issue I see is premature brake wear. If your brakes pads or sliding pins seize, you'll have one pad wearing faster than the rest. Eventually, this pad will wear down to the metal, while the other brake pads still have a significant amount of brake pad lining remaining. However, most shops will sell you a full brake job, including rotors, and fail to tell you about the importance of having a yearly brake service to prevent this from happening in the future. A full brake replacement can cost upwards of $500 or more per axle. A yearly brake service (removing brake pads, calipers and removing rust buildup and re-greasing), will set you back about $50-100, depending on the shop. Best time to do this is in the fall, at the same time your winter tires are installed.  Tire rotations and tire pressure. Tires that are rotated once or twice per year will last much longer than tires that aren't rotated at all, or just once or twice in their lifetime. Also, keep your tires properly inflated as premature tire wear can happen if they are running too soft more often than not. As a bonus, you'll also see improved fuel mileage : ) A tire rotation will set you back about $50-$100 per year, compared to a new set of tires ($650-2000) every 2 or 3 years. A good technician will check your suspension when this is done also and let you know of any loose/worn suspension parts that need to be replaced. A good set of tires that are rotated per manufacturers recommendation will last 5-6 years. I have a set of Michelin Defenders that I bought for our family van in the summer of 2019, and they still have over 50% tread remaining. These tires have just about 100,000km on them, and I rotate them twice per year before installing my winter tires.   Oil changes. Don't neglect your oil changes, you'd be surprised how much more efficient your engine will run when you stay on top of them. Most newer engines have very little tolerances (space) between the moving parts inside the engine. Because of this, many - if not all - manufacturers have moved to recommending a synthetic, light weight oil for your engine (0w-20, 5w20). Why should you worry about frequent oil changes? Dirty, contaminated and degraded oil is detrimental to your engine, it creates excessive heat within it due to poor lubrication (metal on metal). Eventually, your engine will suffer from premature failure, but not before becoming severely affected by sludge buildup which causes oil starvation to critical areas inside your engine (bearing surfaces, VVT systems, oil pump, etc - all very expensive repairs). I recommend Pennzoil Ultra Synthetic (a synthetic oil derived from natureal gas), and it usually goes on sale at Walmart or Canadian Tire at least once per month for under $50 for a 5L jug.   I hope this advice serves you all well. If you have any questions, feel free to ask away! Cheers and hope you're all having a super day.",2023-04-11 18:10:04,981,403,PersonalFinanceCanada

Chinese electric vehicles,"I've been to a boat show recently and they also had some chinese EVs there. I remember when chinese cars looked like european ones bought on wish. This doesn't seem to be the case anymore.  The cars looked very nice, especially in the interior with full leather and all. The quality was hard to judge but it seemed good like any established car brand. And the prices are so ridiculously low it almost seems like a scam.  Are they really just able to sell very competitive EVs at such low prices or is there anything ""wrong"" with these vehicles?",2024-04-28 13:45:50,61,239,electricvehicles
